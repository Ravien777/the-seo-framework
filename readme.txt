= We poured over 18&#160;000 hours into this plugin. Here are the results: =

* **It is brilliant.**
The SEO Framework is an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) for SEO. It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.

* **It comes preconfigured.**
With The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you're not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **It helps you optimize your metadata.**
We made the only SEO plugin that follows Google's webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.

* **It creates a beautiful overview.**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest you how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.

* **It includes exceptional support.**
We don't outsource our support. We're here for you. Feel free to drop by [our support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/) at any time to ask a question. More than 1400 inquiries have been answered personally, typically within 48 hours in the past five years.

* **It leaves no room for errors.**
We focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don't. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won't steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.

* **It remains genuine and pure.**
We built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn't be a billboard for our branding. We won't ever change this.

* **It improves search presence.**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search, and by automatically generating titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines. It also notifies Google, Bing, and all connected search networks automatically of your website's changes with its built-in sitemap.

* **It makes social sharing easy.**
The SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they're shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and Whatsapp.

* **It feels more than accessible.**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.

* **It protects you from mistakes.**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.

* **It follows best-practices and beyond.**
The biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress's API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.

* **It has developers at heart.**
We encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Check out [our API](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82), and feel free to [contribute](https://tsf.fyi/contributing)!

* **It respects your privacy.**
The SEO Framework sends us no information and does not create cookies. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1701#pluginprivacyinformation).

= Unbranded, free and for the professionals =

The SEO Framework is a uniquely white label plugin that blends seamlessly into your WordPress dashboard. This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within your WordPress interface. No ads, no nags. Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your website. Note that we output standardized development-comments distinguishing the plugin output in source code. You can remove these with our free [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2301).

= Behind the screens =

The SEO Framework works on many things without notifying you, because the best software is fast, nimble, responsive, and should save you precious time. Here are a few things it does behind the screens.

* It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.
* It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.
* It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don't send a 404 response.
* It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.
* It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn't mean they won't use them; only, they won't show them in their search results.
* It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.

= Compatibility =

**The SEO Framework supports:**

* PHP 5.6 and higher.
* WordPress 5.1 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Unicode (UTF-8) character recognition and rendering, including Emoji and CJKV (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese).
* Right to Left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, et al.), through its interface and metatag generation.
* Complete color-vision deficiency accessibility thanks to a carefully picked color scheme.
* Full keyboard navigation, so that you can inspect tooltips quickly without ever having to reach for your mouse.
* Full screen-reader accessibility via field anchors, ARIA labels, and title attributes.
* WordPress Multisite setups, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection and output of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Full integration with WordPress Core sitemaps.
* Output of structured data via Schema.org JSON-LD scripts.
* Altering oEmbed for improved sharing on Discord.
* Detection of various other SEO tools to help you switch graciously.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus, and MultilingualPress.
* E-commerce plugins, like WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.
* Editing posts and terms via WordPress's native bulk-and-quick-edit interfaces.

= Copyright legislation notice =

In a few words: The SEO Framework allows search engines to do what they've been doing for the past 20 years via its preconfigured copyright settings.

When you activate The SEO Framework on any site, you automatically grant rights to content aggregators, among Google, Bing, and Yandex, to obtain and use information from the site, including written work, images, audio, and video. You can control these rights via the robots-meta settings brought by this plugin. Your rights and the effectiveness of these settings are subject to your website's region and language, and the physical or virtual origin of the platform and their potential users through which your website's information is obtained and shared. It is up to the aggregator to honor your rights and the requests brought via The SEO Framework.

If you wish to learn more, please refer to the [EU commission on copyright](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/modernisation-eu-copyright-rules). These rulings may propagate its effects through regions outside the EU.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads, tracking, bloat, or nags!
This plugin is slim yet all-inclusive. It's 100% freeware, not crippleware.

= Is there a premium version? =

No. We treat this plugin as a premium plugin already.

However, we do offer many free and paid extensions that help support this free plugin. We provide these via our free [Extension Manager plugin](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= Why is there no analytics, tracking, or 404 monitoring? =

SEO experts that use advanced tools such as Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, and Google Analytics prefer using The SEO Framework because it doesn't try to do their job haphazardly.

To correctly analyze your website, it must be done from the outside. If we load these features on your site, bad robots will cause thousands of false positives that fill your database with useless information that doesn't apply to search engines. We refrain from this because it won't ever help you anyway.

= I have a feature request, a question, or found a bug. =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.

We'll try to get back to you within a week. Typically, we reply within three days.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

Learn more [about contributing](https://tsf.fyi/contributing).

= What do the colors tell me? =

We use different colors to convey messages. Red is an error that you must resolve. Yellow is a non-critical warning that you may want to address. Green is good. Blue is informational and situational. Gray is undefined or unprocessable.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, et al. =

Not having every single page listed is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.

If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760). It brings extensions, like [Articles](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2303), that fill in the gaps via modern and more robust means.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option for it. This option will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

In the meantime, you can disable SEO for the unwanted entries via the "General SEO Settings" under "Exclusions."

= Why aren't focus keywords included? =

[Google warns](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/irrelevant-keywords) about the keyword stuffing approach implemented by some other SEO plugins. It forces users to write unnatural content, and it can have adverse effects on your site's ranking.

Modern search engines use AI to understand the context of your articles. This means that as long as you write relevant content, you shouldn't have to worry about keywords.

However, we implemented the same API Google uses to help you find appropriate synonyms and inflections for your keywords. This functionality is part of our premium suite of extensions.

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers that tell search engines how to connect and index the site. We do this via the Schema.org standard.

They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, which social sites you're connected to, and what page structure you're using. This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= I don't see the breadcrumbs! =

The SEO Framework does not provide the display of breadcrumbs. This is theme-territory. This plugin only annotates them for search engines via a JSON-LD script.

If you wish to display breadcrumbs, then your theme should provide this. Alternatively, there are [other plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/breadcrumbs/) that help you do this.

== Changelog ==

PUNTED -- not important for 4.2.0:

TODO deprecate _do_settings_page_notices(), and use the new persistent notice system instead.
	-> Rename set_plugin_check_caches() to `notify_user_of_conflicting_plugin( 'seo' )`.
	-> In effect, do_dismissible_notice()?
		-> The notice called at `_output_notices()` can be used with persistent notices as well.
			-> In fact, we can make it Multisite compatible that way. Sub site has SEO plugin->main site activates conflicting SEO plugin->notice on sub-site.
				-> Show 3x. Delete if detected conflict is gone (hook at plugin_activated). -> Test show 10x to make sure it works as intended (activate/deactivate, etc.).
TODO Move notice handlers to new class.
TODO overthrow the structured data. Clean-room Yoast's/WPSSO/AIOSEO implementation? It's not necessarily better or more useful to users, but it eases interfacing via extensions and filters.

TODO `apply_filters_deprecated` feeds us a junk caller-line. Copy so it supports classes?
	-> Is this not a WP bug? I'd assume they test for class-scopes, but I also assumed Gutenberg wouldn't get imposed on us in such a bad state.
	-> This is actually why we set up a custom `_deprecation_function()`.

TODO introduce a settings generator, even if high-level?
TODO s_...$new_value -> $something_else?

= 4.2.0 =

TODO clean up autodescription.php, now we can finally make it PHP 5.6+.
	-> What's there to clean? Well, we could move the constants around... and we could add namespacing... yay.
	-> We can remove the envtest file and in place put headers in autodescription.php
	-> also delete option the_seo_framework_tested_upgrade_version

TODO this is no longer 'minor'... In this update, we polished the final rough bits we found.

TODO fix js lint warnings about the l10n const being unavailable.
	-> This probably affects all files. Addressing this with modern JS could prevent unforeseen bugs with future FSE.

TODO https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/185
	-> This will allow bigger sitemaps, for we won't accidentally call redundant post meta.
	-> This forces us to implement a migrator, which we should...
	-> This will cause all sorts of issues we cannot help our users with.
		-> Although this will help speed up queries, especially those of large sites, it will hinder large sites for they might use special queries to test against TSF.
			-> Then again, you should assert in PHP more than the database. TSF's "qubit" system is a poster child for that.

TODO allow custom robots generators?
TODO update https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/constants/ with `\The_SEO_Framework\ROBOTS_ASSERT`

TODO get_home_canonical_url() needs an admin-friendly-non-pagination-test version.
TODO further optimize get_word_count(), array flips and whatnot...

TODO translation POT file.

TODO _suggest_temp... :)
TODO implement WP Fix for sitemaps and use get_posts()?
	-> This would explode the RAM usage, but reduce the number of expensive get_post() calls in is_private/get_permalink
		-> However, the way we do it now, the cache is properly instigated... Needs investigation.

TODO add CSS templating colors?
	-> Also from Core, and their "relative" friends? I don't think WP uses "var" in production?
	-> This should speed up some stuff, and makes the plugin easier to maintain.

TODO test title trimming..?

TODO Default the metabox in the far-too-tiny sidebar of Gutenberg on "is_gutenberg_page()"?
	-> Users will face issues moving back the metabox.
		-> This PR will fix that, though... https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/25187, eventually.

TODO reset the metabox order of the SEO Settings page?
	-> Should we delete user settings, keeping things tidy?
		-> toplevel_page_theseoframework-settings / tsf()->seo_settings_page_hook
		-> see core wp_ajax_meta_box_order()
			-> update_user_meta( $user->ID, "meta-box-order_$page", $order );
				-> `delete_user_meta( 0, 'meta-box-order_' . tsf()->seo_settings_page_hook, false, true );`
		-> Should we annotate this in https://tsf.fyi/kb/a/108?
	-> We'll reset it again (purging the option completely) in TSF 5.0...

TODO replace -metabox' -> '
	-> Then replace -metabox.php -> .php
	-> The folder name already tells it contains metaboxes.

TODO we removed `?: $this->get_tax_type_label( \get_queried_object()->taxonomy ?? '', false );` in `get_generate_archive_title_from_query()`, which will probably cause issues with "The Events Calendar"'s broken query.
	-> Should we add a compat file auto-excluding their non-WP coherent "post type"?

TODO regex to find non-breaking HTML attributes: class=example.
	-> input type="text" -> input type=text

Accepts 'id' and 'taxonomy'.
Accepts 'id', 'taxonomy', and 'pta'.

tsfTitle.useSocialTagline -> tsfSocial.addAdditions

TODO modernize getStateOf. => ?.

TODO data-social-group -> add subgroup -> utilize -> automate.
	-> This way, we need not register the element IDs. Instead, it can automatically retrieve them by "social-group"

TODO add debouncer in tsf.js?
	-> tsf.debounce( () => { }, timeout, key || void 0 );

TODO add maxlength to title/description input fields?
	-> Also enforce it in the back-end?
	-> This will prevent overloading the database with large blobs. However, users can do this anywhere in WP, regardless.

TODO add "padlock" to the counters on the homepage "page edit screen" if it's locked via the homepage SEO settings?

TODO process changelog https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/compare/64b64e28e534304ee7e1bea65b25e8ec46241f85...master

TODO make output_pixel_counter_wrap et alia auto-bind to inputs?
	-> Will this work with quick/bulk-edit?

TODO PTA robots: default noindex when set for post type or when no posts are found for the type.

**For everyone:**

* **Upgrade notes:**
	* PHP 7.2 or higher is now required, from PHP 5.6 or higher.
	* WP 5.5 or higher is now required, from WP 5.1 or higher. Reasons:
		* Removal of redundant timezone patches, fixed in WP 5.3.
		* Archive title translations were changed in WP 5.5, now we no longer have to support two versions.
		* Various "unexplainable" bugs have been resolved, among [one where archive titles could be empty](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47573) (although not brought up in that ticket, it solved the issue). These fixes alleviate our support burden.
		* Core Sitemaps support is now mandatory. We no longer have to say "if" you have WP 5.5 or later.
		* Core Sitemaps brought a new escaping method, `esc_xml()`, which will ensure future security.
		* Support for newer (less buggy) admin styles, such as a proper "default" button for the color-picker in WP 5.5 or later.
		* We no longer need to support WordPress and PHP environment testing, of which the burden was shifted to WP 5.2.
* **Changed:**
	* The styled optimized sitemap now has its content centered, and is fully responsive.
	* TSF no longer outputs metatags on Ultimate Memmber's user-pages. Now, it lets that plugin take over fully.
	* TSF no longer tests for the correct PHP or WordPress version -- we now rely on WordPress handling this.
		* WordPress isn't as gracious as we were: WP doesn't deactivate the plugin if you upload an incompatible version via FTP, which TSF did. However, we consider this an edge case beyond corners.
* **Improved:**
	* **Sitemaps:**
		* Aside from the optimized sitemap being centered and responsive, it now also fully embraces RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, et al.).
	* **Performance:**
		* TODO The plugin is now TODO% faster (PHP/JS/CSS/etc.).
			* JS: 1.5x fewer style-recalc per second.
		* Images are now fetched faster from the content.
		* The SEO Bar now parses the title item faster.
		* Open Graph and Twitter titles are now fetched faster when no custom one is provided.
		* Open Graph, Twitter, and meta titles are now regenerated faster.
		* The canonical URL of the current page is now stored in memory, so it won't get fetched multiple times.
		* The robots-meta is now generated on-demand only, meaning sitemaps generate much faster once more.
			-> TODO this isn't really faster now...? Further code enhancements did help somewhat.
		* Large sitemaps are now rendered more quickly by the browser.
		* Tooltips despawn 25% quicker now.
		* Tapping the tooltip no longer conjures tooltip animations, potentially saving battery-life.
		* Administrative Markdown-text now generates a tad swifter.
		* Throughout the plugin, we found ways to reduce opcodes.
		* The bootstrap timer keeps timing while metadata is strapping. This time spent is added to both timers. We rectified the "boot" timer.
			* The reason is that the plugin should be done "booting" once it starts generating the metadata.
			* This issue became more apparent once we started splitting the generators in their respective builder-classes.
		* Addressed an issue where canonical URLs accidentally bypassed some caches. This should vastly improve canonical URL and Structured Data generation.
		* Twitter Cards generate 61% quicker now by removing redundant tests.
		* Twitter and description inputs now use generators to assert the correct description that only sanitize the input when there is some, halving total input-processing time.
		* Those title and description's input counters are now synchronized at 60fps, instead of at 75~100fps sporadically.
			* Only the trained eye can spot a minor delay on low response time monitors, but only whilst holding a repeat-key, which isn't realistic.
		* Image previews now get loaded only after the "slowest" typist is done typing the image URL.
		* When no excerpt of the content can be fetched, needless trimming no longer happens.
	* **Timestamps:**
		* The plugin no longer rectifies the timezones for its timestamps in the sitemap or for Facebook/Open Graph meta data, for it now relies on WP 5.3's patches.
	* **Notices:**
		* Upgrade notices are now persistent; so, now you won't miss an auto-upgrade.
			* Shown only to users with `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SETTINGS_CAP` (default `update_options`) capability.
			* Shown once globally.
			* These messages are always truly white-label; there's no mention of "The SEO Framework".
		* The first-activation notice is now persistent.
			* Shown only to users with `activate_plugins` capability.
			* Shown twice globally.
			* Shown only within two minutes of activation.
			* On multisite, it can be shown on every sub-site, unless the plugin is network activated, then you'll see it only on the main site.
	* **Accessibility:**
		* The SEO Bar item "Redirect" now conveys a more proper message when the page status is draft: "... once published."
		* "Duplicated words" is now "repeated words."
		* The Optimized Sitemap's settings now explain there might be multiple sitemaps when Polylang or WPML is detected.
		* The Title Settings their examples now better reflect real-world usage in certain corner cases.
	* **Other:**
		* Shortened Optimized Sitemap's stylesheet's trimmed URL length from 96 to 93 characters, with the maximum decreased from 99 to 95 characters.
		* We did Elementor's developer's job by marking the post types `elementor_library` and `e-landing-page` as "not-publicly-queryable" -- but only for The SEO Framework.
			* If we'd mark it as "not-publicly-queryable" for all of WordPress, some functionality in Elementor might break. We do not care for that.
			* Elementor's devs had to mark it conditionally-public instead of conditionally-not-public. Thinking backwardly poses some difficulty for the average mind. Nevertheless, that'd remove about 2000 support inquiries for/about them yearly.
* **Removed:**
	* Toggled off by default three years ago, hidden for almost all users one year ago, and now removed entirely: The Optimized Sitemap's priority-meta feature. This feature hasn't been used by any popular search engine for a long time.
	* Older browsers no longer support window-resize support for the tabs of the "inpost SEO meta box."
* **Fixed:**
	* Addressed an issue after using keyboard navigation to invoke tooltips, a mouse hover to invoke a tooltip didn't clear the keyboard-invoked tooltip when spawned elsewhere.
	* Addressed an issue after using mouse hover to invoke tooltips, after using keyboard navigation to invoke tooltips, a mouse click to invoke a tooltip thence caused the arrow to not animate correctly.
	* Addressed an issue with settings-headless mode where the list-edit (quick/bulk-edit) features was untentionally disabled; it's now disabled when the meta-headless mode is enabled.
	* Addressed a corner-case issue with Polylang where on WP installations instated prior WP v4.4 the primary sitemap got emptied when no new languages have been setup since WP v4.4 or later.
	* Addressed a regression from TSF v4.1.4 where the Schema.org setting "Logo URL" couldn't be selected nor could the Sitemap Logo be assigned correctly (due to assigning duplicated _unique_ IDs).
	* Addressed an off-by-one error causing the first content-image to be skipped for social sharing. [Props daxelrod](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/content-social-image-skips-first-image/).
		* This fix also addresses that "only" 'four' images got taken from the content, instead of the intended 'five'.
	* Addressed a regression where a part of the HTML comments was not fully translatable.
	* Addressed layout issues where the site title might be smaller than 60px, making the examples have too much surrounding space. This also fixed an edge-case issue that caused text to overflow the meta boxes.
	* Addressed several edge-case instances where placeholders didn't properly reflect the actual output.

**For developers:**

* **Plugin database version is now at `4200` (TODO)**.
* **Added:**
	* We introduce function `tsf()`, an alias of `the_seo_framework()`.
* **Changed:**
	* The sitemap stylesheet now uses a different HTML hierarchy to output items. We made this change so we could center the sitemap.
		* We also offloaded the sitemap's styles over different "views". Located at `inc/views/sitemap/xsl`.
	* Throughout the code, you'll find we now use more modern PHP syntax, since we jumped off the delapidated PHP v5.6 boat, and onto the [deprecated PHP v7.2 one](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php).
		* Over [25% of hosts are NOT doing their jobs](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) to keep your site secure.
	* Throughout the code, we removed typehinting. Typehinting is great for API consistency, but we thoroughly and correctly prefix every function with documentation on which type to use.
		* The goal was to remove redundant opcodes.
		* Yes, typehinting can help find bugs in development. But, its results can be catastrophic on user websites, something we do not have the time to deal with. We expect other developers to uphold the API.
		* In the future, OpCache might look for typehints and use those to improve performance. When that day comes, we'll typehint everything we can.
	* For the description generator, we removed the "on 'Blogname'" part on the homepage and blog page.
		* We did this to ease integration of a custom blog name, which would otherwise have to be reflected in that description, making for smelly code we did not want to maintain.
		* This change does not affect ranking directly.
		* It'd be best if you provide a custom description, regardless. Search engines can also ignore your descriptions when they don't meet certain requirements, which this one never did.
* **Fixed:**
	* Addressed output-deprecation notice in the meta-debugger from TSF v4.1.4.
* **Option notes:**
	* For option index `autodescription-site-settings` (filter `the_seo_framework_site_options`, constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`):
		* Index `show_priority` is no longer used nor sanitized.
			* Updating the options will purge this index. Then, it'll be rendered as disabled on downgrade.
		* Index `knowledge_name` is no longer 'sanitized and escaped' on-save, but now only 'sanitized'.
		* Index `site_title` is new, and overrides WordPress's `\get_bloginfo( 'name' )` value used within The SEO Framework.
			* This affects all titles, including those of Structured Data (which can be superseded by `knowledge_name`).
	* Global option `the_seo_framework_tested_upgrade_version` is now removed. We let WordPress test for us now (WP5.2+ feature).
* **Function notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `tsf()`, an alias of `the_seo_framework()`. They have exactly the same opcodes, so neither is faster than the other. Pick your poison.
		* `\The_SEO_Framework\memo()` stores and returns memoized values for the caller.
			* This function is neat because you can use it without specifying a caching key; it knows who invokes it: `return memo() ?? memo( expensive_call() );`.
				* This neatness is limited to methods, not files or lines. Yet, this allows you to call `memo()` multiple times per method.
			* The second and later parameters can be used to forward arguments.
			* We found it impossible to further optimize this method. If you inspect its source, you find it does things in reverse, assigns variables unnecessarily, etc. This all leads to PHP performing it quickest; both during set and fetch.
		* `\The_SEO_Framework\umemo()` stores and returns memoized values for the caller using a user-defined key.
			* This function is roughly 10 times faster than `\The_SEO_Framework\memo()`, but requires from you a unique identifier `$key`. Example: `return umemo( __METHOD__ ) ?? umemo( __METHOD__, expensive_call() );`
	* **Removed:**
		* `the_seo_framework_boot()`
			* This function was marked as "private," and should've never been used publicly.
* **Object notes:**
	* Henceforth, `SeoBar` is now referred to as `SEOBar`. This affects namespaces and classes.
		* In PHP, those are case-insensitive; so, nothing changes here.
	* For object `\The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Ping`:
		* **Methods added:**
			* `get_ping_url()`
	* For object `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\SEOBar\<Page|Term>`:
		* **Method changed:**
			* `get_query_cache()` no longer returns the robots-copyright data at `['states']['robotsmeta']`. Use the options API instead.
	* These objects are marked as private and should not be called. This is informational only.
		* Object `The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Robots\Main` is new.
			* Used by new object `The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Robots\Args` and `The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Robots\Query`.
			* Use public method `tsf()->generate_robots_meta()` to access the builder.
		* Object `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\SeoBar` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\SEOBar\Main`.
		* Object `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\SeoBar_Page` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\SEOBar\Page`.
		* Object `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\SeoBar_Term` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\SEOBar\Term`.
		* Object `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Sitemap_Base` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Sitemap\Base`.
		* Object `\The_SEO_Framework\Debug` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\Internal\Debug`.
		* Object `\The_SEO_Framework\Deprecated` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\Internal\Deprecated`.
		* Object `\The_SEO_Framework\Interpreters\Sitemap_XSL` is new.
	* Object `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Sitemap` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Sitemap\Main`.
		* A class alias is made Just-in-Time to smoothen deprecation.
	* For object `\The_SEO_Framework\Load` (callable via `tsf()` and `the_seo_framework()`):
		* **Methods added:**
			* `get_home_url()`, a memoized version of WordPress Core's `get_home_url()`.
			* `retrieve_robots_meta_assertions()`, returns the last cycle's robots-assertions. Only returns data when asserting is enabled.
			* `is_home_as_page()`, detects the non-front blog page.
			* `get_filtered_raw_blogname()` fetches the filtered blogname without considering TSF's `site_title` option.
		* **Methods changed:**
			* `do_meta_output()`
				1. Now invokes two actions before and after output.
				1. No longer rectifies timezones.
			* `generate_robots_meta()` only returns what you want it to generate now (by default, nothing changes).
			* `get_author_canonical_url()`
				1. The first parameter is now optional.
				2. When the $id isn't set, the URL won't get tested for pagination issues.
			* `get_available_twitter_cards()`
				1. No longer memoizes the return value.
				2. No longer tests for the Twitter title.
			* `get_conflicting_plugins()` now always runs the filter (`the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins_type`), even when `$type` is not registered.
			* `get_plugin_indicator()` is no longer publicly accessible.
			* `get_relative_fontcolor` optimized code, but it now has some rounding changes at the end. This could offset the returned values by 1/255th.
			* `get_robots_post_type_option_id` no longer sanitizes the input parameter.
			* `get_robots_taxonomy_option_id` no longer sanitizes the input parameter.
			* `get_static_front_page_title()` &amp; alias `get_blogname()`
				1. Now listens to the new `site_title` option.
				2. Now applies filters.
			* `get_taxonomical_canonical_url()`:
				1. Added memoization.
				1. The parameters are now optional.
			* `get_taxonomical_custom_canonical_url()`, the first parameter is now optional.
			* `get_term_meta_item()` no longer accidentally returns an empty array on failure, but `null` (as intended) instead.
			* `get_singular_canonical_url()`
				1. Added memoization.
				1. When the `$id` isn't set, the URL won't get tested for pagination issues.
			* `get_singular_custom_canonical_url()`, the first parameter is now optional.
			* `has_custom_canonical_url()` now also detects canonical URLs for taxonomies.
			* `hellip_if_over()` no longer prepends a space before the hellip.
			* `init_cron_actions()` is now a protected method, and can no longer be accessed.
			* `is_home()`, added the first parameter to allow custom query testing.
			* `is_theme()` no longer "loads" the theme; instead, simply compares input to active theme options.
			* **The following methods now support the `$args = [ 'pta' => $post_type ]` parameter:**
				*
		* **Methods deprecated:**
			* `append_php_query()`, use `tsf()->append_url_query()` instead.
			* `get_html_output()`, with no alternative available.

* **Constant notes:**
	* **Namespace `\The_SEO_Framework\`**
		* `ROBOTS_ASSERT`, used for the `tsf()->robots_meta()` method family; makes the generator store assertions at the slight cost of performance.
			* Use `tsf()->retrieve_robots_meta_assertions()` to obtain what's asserted in the last run.

	* **Added:**
		* `the_seo_framework_tell_multilingual_sitemap`, whether to tell about multilingual sitemaps on the setting pages.
		* `the_seo_framework_generated_archive_title_prefix`, filters the archive title prefix.
		* These should never be used. If I find you use these filters in the wild, I'll call you out for being a dumb developer. Properly annotate your post types and taxonomies before thinking about touching these filters!

			* `the_seo_framework_public_taxonomies`, filters public taxonomies.this filter!
	* **Changed:**

		* **The following filters have had their needless second parameter (`$args`) removed:**
			* `the_seo_framework_general_settings_tabs`
			* `the_seo_framework_homepage_settings_tabs`

	* **Added:**

		* `the_seo_framework_after_meta_output`, this replaces filters `the_seo_framework_pro` and `the_seo_framework_after_output`
* **JavaScript notes:**
	* Object `window.tsfTT`:
		* **Changed:**
			* `doTooltip`
				1. Can now work asynchronously.
				1. Now returns boolean whether the tooltip was entered successfully.
			* `getTooltip` now returns a `HTMLElement` instead of a `jQuery.Element`.
* **Other:**
	* Removed workarounds for [PHP bug 75771](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=75771).
	* You can now autoload The SEO Framework's classes using the wrong case for the first "chunk" of namespace: `\ThE_sEo_FrAmEwOrK\`.
		* Pro tip: Don't. We 'implemented' it only in the spirit of PHP's case-handling.

= 4.1.5.1 =

This patch addresses an oversight whence primary terms could no longer get fetched.

= 4.1.5 =

This minor update adds support for Gutenberg 11.3.0 and [fixes a few bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3756#detailed).

= 4.1.4 =

This minor update packs a major punch. TSF now supports [headless mode](https://kb.theseoframework.com/?p=136), cementing itself as a turnkey solution. We defenestrated the pernicious object caching mechanism, and we updated some options' defaults effective only on new sites. We improved performance iterably, fixed about 12 bugs, and enjoyed the weather. Lastly, we introduced a new API for user meta handling, among other things --- developers that wrote software interfacing with TSF are employed well reading the [detailed changelog](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3727#detailed).

= 4.1.3 =

Before heading into 2021, we wanted to [set free four bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3660#detailed).

Pro tip: If you can no longer switch TSF's settings tabs, try hitting 'CMD+OPTION+R' (Safari Mac), 'CMD+SHIFT+R' (Chrome/Firefox Mac), or 'CTRL+SHIFT+R' (Windows); these keyboard shortcuts will force-fetch the latest scripts from your server.

= 4.1.2 =

In this minor update, we ensured compatibility with PHP 8 and WP 5.6. TSF now also fully integrates with WordPress Core Sitemaps, which you can configure via the SEO settings. If you decide to keep using TSF's optimized sitemap, you can now enjoy prerendering, DoS protection, and full Polylang integration. Lastly, you'll find various accessibility improvements, and we fixed [about a dozen bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3650#detailed).

We included a single-line self-destructing notification about our [Cyber Monday sale](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3527). We hope you'll opt to support our continuous efforts. But we're also kindly asking you to understand we must promote our premium extensions to make TSF possible. We are apprehensive about any embedded advertising and self-promotion in the plugin, so we must rely on notifications until a better system is available in WordPress.

= 4.1.1 =

In this major-minor update, we improved browser performance by up to 99% (not a typo) by exchanging over 300 jQuery calls for vanilla JS ones. We also added two new options for oEmbed, freed a dozen bugs that got stuck in the UI and generators, and [improved accessibility](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3623#detailed).

= 4.1.0 - Grace =

*A related quote of a book I just read or film I just saw - [Author]()*

**Release highlights**

* TODO Cool stuff
* TODO More stuff

**Environment upgrade notes**

WordPress 5.1 through 5.4 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Over 66% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using version 5.5 or later.
* Newer versions of WordPress are faster, more reliable, and easier to work with; for both you and us.
* Supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.

**Support the development**

We hope you'll love this update as much as we do. Please consider supporting us by sharing [an awesome review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/reviews/#new-topic-0), [get a license](https://theseoframework.com/pricing/), or do your friends and colleagues a favor by installing TSF.
