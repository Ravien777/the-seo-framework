= We poured over 18&#160;000 hours into this plugin. Here are the results: =

* **It is brilliant.**
The SEO Framework is an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) for SEO. It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.

* **It comes preconfigured.**
With The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you're not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **It helps you optimize your metadata.**
We made the only SEO plugin that follows Google's webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.

* **It creates a beautiful overview.**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest you how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.

* **It includes exceptional support.**
We don't outsource our support. We're here for you. Feel free to drop by [our support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/) at any time to ask a question. More than 1400 inquiries have been answered personally, typically within 48 hours in the past five years.

* **It leaves no room for errors.**
We focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don't. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won't steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.

* **It remains genuine and pure.**
We built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn't be a billboard for our branding. We won't ever change this.

* **It improves search presence.**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search, and by automatically generating titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines. It also notifies Google, Bing, and all connected search networks automatically of your website's changes with its built-in sitemap.

* **It makes social sharing easy.**
The SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they're shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and Whatsapp.

* **It feels more than accessible.**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.

* **It protects you from mistakes.**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.

* **It follows best-practices and beyond.**
The biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress's API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.

* **It has developers at heart.**
We encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Check out [our API](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82), and feel free to [contribute](https://tsf.fyi/contributing)!

* **It respects your privacy.**
The SEO Framework sends us no information and does not create cookies. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1701#pluginprivacyinformation).

= Unbranded, free and for the professionals =

The SEO Framework is a uniquely white label plugin that blends seamlessly into your WordPress dashboard. This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within your WordPress interface. No ads, no nags. Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your website. Note that we output standardized development-comments distinguishing the plugin output in source code. You can remove these with our free [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2301).

= Behind the screens =

The SEO Framework works on many things without notifying you, because the best software is fast, nimble, responsive, and should save you precious time. Here are a few things it does behind the screens.

* It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.
* It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.
* It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don't send a 404 response.
* It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.
* It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn't mean they won't use them; only, they won't show them in their search results.
* It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.

= Compatibility =

**The SEO Framework supports:**

* PHP 5.6 and higher.
* WordPress 5.1 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Unicode (UTF-8) character recognition and rendering, including Emoji and CJKV (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese).
* Right to Left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, et al.), through its interface and metatag generation.
* Complete color-vision deficiency accessibility thanks to a carefully picked color scheme.
* Full keyboard navigation, so that you can inspect tooltips quickly without ever having to reach for your mouse.
* Full screen-reader accessibility via field anchors, ARIA labels, and title attributes.
* WordPress Multisite setups, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection and output of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Full integration with WordPress Core sitemaps.
* Output of structured data via Schema.org JSON-LD scripts.
* Altering oEmbed for improved sharing on Discord.
* Detection of various other SEO tools to help you switch graciously.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus, and MultilingualPress.
* E-commerce plugins, like WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.
* Editing posts and terms via WordPress's native bulk-and-quick-edit interfaces.

= Copyright legislation notice =

In a few words: The SEO Framework allows search engines to do what they've been doing for the past 20 years via its preconfigured copyright settings.

When you activate The SEO Framework on any site, you automatically grant rights to content aggregators, among Google, Bing, and Yandex, to obtain and use information from the site, including written work, images, audio, and video. You can control these rights via the robots-meta settings brought by this plugin. Your rights and the effectiveness of these settings are subject to your website's region and language, and the physical or virtual origin of the platform and their potential users through which your website's information is obtained and shared. It is up to the aggregator to honor your rights and the requests brought via The SEO Framework.

If you wish to learn more, please refer to the [EU commission on copyright](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/modernisation-eu-copyright-rules). These rulings may propagate its effects through regions outside the EU.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads, tracking, bloat, or nags!
This plugin is slim yet all-inclusive. It's 100% freeware, not crippleware.

= Is there a premium version? =

No. We treat this plugin as a premium plugin already.

However, we do offer many free and paid extensions that help support this free plugin. We provide these via our free [Extension Manager plugin](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= Why is there no analytics, tracking, or 404 monitoring? =

SEO experts that use advanced tools such as Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, and Google Analytics prefer using The SEO Framework because it doesn't try to do their job haphazardly.

To correctly analyze your website, it must be done from the outside. If we load these features on your site, bad robots will cause thousands of false positives that fill your database with useless information that doesn't apply to search engines. We refrain from this because it won't ever help you anyway.

= I have a feature request, a question, or found a bug. =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.

We'll try to get back to you within a week. Typically, we reply within three days.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

Learn more [about contributing](https://tsf.fyi/contributing).

= What do the colors tell me? =

We use different colors to convey messages. Red is an error that you must resolve. Yellow is a non-critical warning that you may want to address. Green is good. Blue is informational and situational. Gray is undefined or unprocessable.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, et al. =

Not having every single page listed is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.

If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760). It brings extensions, like [Articles](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2303), that fill in the gaps via modern and more robust means.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option for it. This option will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

In the meantime, you can disable SEO for the unwanted entries via the "General SEO Settings" under "Exclusions."

= Why aren't focus keywords included? =

[Google warns](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/irrelevant-keywords) about the keyword stuffing approach implemented by some other SEO plugins. It forces users to write unnatural content, and it can have adverse effects on your site's ranking.

Modern search engines use AI to understand the context of your articles. This means that as long as you write relevant content, you shouldn't have to worry about keywords.

However, we implemented the same API Google uses to help you find appropriate synonyms and inflections for your keywords. This functionality is part of our premium suite of extensions.

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers that tell search engines how to connect and index the site. We do this via the Schema.org standard.

They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, which social sites you're connected to, and what page structure you're using. This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= I don't see the breadcrumbs! =

The SEO Framework does not provide the display of breadcrumbs. This is theme-territory. This plugin only annotates them for search engines via a JSON-LD script.

If you wish to display breadcrumbs, then your theme should provide this. Alternatively, there are [other plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/breadcrumbs/) that help you do this.

== Changelog ==

= 4.1.4 =

Marketing:
	TODO 4.2.0 - Headless?
	TODO: This minor update packs a big punch... we've added headless mode, we've defenestrated the object caching mechanism, etc. etc. We've removed _40_ methods that were otherwise needlessly registered on the front-end. -> who cares?
	TODO update `https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/constants/` (more than just THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_HEADLESS)
	TODO test plugin size change, it could be less, no?
		-> With the class-deprecations removed, that could make up for a lot.

Extension Manager:
	TODO test Headless + Auto-activate Extension Manager + Extensions (prominently: Focus (headless settings only), Articles/Title-Fix/Honeypot (fully headless) ).
		-> Yes, this works. Please see constants `TSF_EXTENSION_MANAGER_API_INFORMATION` and `TSF_EXTENSION_MANAGER_FORCED_EXTENSIONS` to manage the subscription and extension activation respectively.

Programming:
	TODO deprecate is_wc_shop et co. for real.
	TODO add filter to getbloginfo sitename??? get_blogname() and get_static_front_page_title()... Why do we have both?
		-> We use blogname for anything that wants the blogname... and static front page ONLY for the frontpage's <title> tag.
	TODO remove UM data, add profile picture to image-generator?
		-> https://wordpress.org/support/topic/double-the-seo-2/#post-14087556
	TODO move profile.class.php functions to admin-pages.class.php and a separated class.
		* Reference: `_init_term_edit_view()` && `_update_term_meta()`
		* `_update_user_settings()` -> `_update_user_meta()`

**For everyone:**

* **Added:**
	* Don't care about SEO? Now you can use TSF headlessly. Simply add the following snippet to your `wp-config.php` file or a (mu-)plugin:
		* `define( 'THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_HEADLESS', true );`
			* This constant must be defined before action `plugins_loaded` priority `5`.
			* This constant also listens to granular control by setting an array instead of a boolean. See our [Constant API docs](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/constants/#user-definable).
			* This constant denies access to database calls, speeding up your website tremendously. However, your SEO (meta) settings won't work.
			* (But...) This constant can be used conditionally when used in a (mu-)plugin; for example, only super-admins can modify the settings/meta-data. Then, you must disable headlessness on the front-end for them to have an effect.
* **Changed:**
	* **Option defaults:**
		* "Remove author name?" (from oEmbed) is now enabled by default. We asserted only Discord using this feature in the wild, and found those who care think Discord's way of handling it undesired.
		* "Apply `noindex` to every second or later archive page?" is now disabled by default. We found that, even though it helps search engines crawl your website more quickly, blocking paginated archives could actually be deleterious to indexing old content in select scenarios.
			* We may consider reverting this decision once we can discern separate "post type archive" (including a separate "blog") options for this.
		* "Sitemap Query Limit" is now lowered to 1000 items, from 3000.
			* In combination with not applying `noindex` to every second or later archive page, this will improve indexing rate for almost all sites. This change also reduces the strain on your server, especially when you have many other plugins adding post meta to each post.
	* Redirected pages/posts/terms\* are no longer included in the sitemap. For real this time.
		* *\* WordPress Core sitemaps can display terms; our optimized version does not*.
* **Improved:**
	* Continuing the trend we set since TSF v4.0.0, we reduced the size of the main object of TSF significantly by offloading various methods to flyweight objects. This should improve load times, albeit only a little.
	* The quick-edit column for the Visibiity setting is now 1.5x wider on non-mobile. This change might take some 'getting used to,' but now you can read the URLs you put in.
* **Removed:**
	* Object caching of the HTML output of TSF.
		* We [theorized no benefit having this feature](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/565), and thought it rather harmful; later, [we found this true empirically](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/enabled-object-cache-doesnt-allow-to-filter-robots-meta/).
		* This does not mean we removed basic object caching support! We only purged our very custom implementation for it. You do not need to clear your object cache after updating, and you won't find performance altered.
* **Updated:**
	* `[?]`/Documentation links to various official Google and Bing resources no longer need to redirect to their latest articles.
* **Other:**
	* WordPress 5.7 comes with improved robots-directives support. The improvements only go so far, and although WordPress seems dogmatic about bringing the editor experience to the front-end, it falls completely flat recognizing that the back-end query-system is disjointed from the front-end, as such is the newly 'improved' robots-directives support. Because we reliably rely on reliable queries with reliance, we are left with no choice but to strip some of its conflicting functionality from Core, without changing the fully fledged experience you've come to expect from TSF. To summarize our actions:
		* TSF will not integrate with this new Core feature for now.
		* TSF will remove some of WordPress 5.7 robots support on these pages:
			* `noindex` for search. TSF supports this feature with a toggle already. When TSF doesn't support the search query's query (yes, that's a thing), this directive can be reinstated via Core.
			* The new robots-directive support for maximum-image-preview-directives throughout your site, regardless whether a page is supported by TSF or not. TSF allows you much greater control and supports this directive quintessentially in principle on all pages it supports. We removed this output from WordPress as an enforced opt-out of this directive because there's a conflict of policy, exempting foreboding legal issues from your potential clients for whatever TSF promises on its settings-pages to the site owners. ELI2: no copyright WP-robots, yes copyright TSF-robots. "But... but...!", -- no, talk to your lawyer.
		* TSF will not remove the newly added `noindex` for embed pages. WordPress can detect embeds, and plugins or themes might respond differently (unpredictably) when embedded.
		* TSF will not remove the refactored WordPress method for outputting `noindex` when the blog isn't set to public. TSF will warn you about this still -- very much so.
		* TSF will not remove any implementation from other plugins or themes. First, this is definitely not a domain of a theme. Secondly, we cannot predict what others plugin authors might do, and we're very much inclinded to shift the blame... always.
	* WordPress 5.8 brings no conflicting changes.
	* TODO It's 2021 now... so we extended the plugin's copyright year notes.
	* TODO TSF is now copyrighted by someone else... well, still me, but using a different name.
	* "The SEO Framework Title Fix" plugin (from WordPress.org, no longer available), no longer works with The SEO Framework from this version onward.
		* Use our Extension Manager's [Title Fix](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/title-fix/) instead. Or, better yet, update your theme to follow the latest standards at least once every decade.
* **Fixed:**
	* The expected sitemap URL now generates a correct URL for (WordPress, WordPress Multisite, Polylang, WPML, etc.) subdirectories.
	* Addressed an issue where "Apply `noindex` to every second or later page on the homepage?" wasn't honored when the homepage is force-indexed via the homepage's post meta.
	* Addressed an issue where the character counter wasn't aligned pixel-perfectly on RTL-language sites.
	* Addressed an issue where in quick-edit, the homepage title wasn't locked correctly, causing it and its counters to render incorrectly.
	* TSF now disables WooCommerce's robots-meta output, and its new WP 5.7 implementation thereof. In turn, TSF will hint `noindex` as default for the Cart, Checkout, and Profile (My Account) pages, regardless of your SEO settings otherwise.
		* Now, you can also overwrite these settings effectively.
			* Cool: TSF will warn that WooCommerce recommends otherwise via the SEO Bar.
				* When you don't overwrite its state, TSF will then tell WooCommerce recommended this state.
		* Because of this, TSF will now remove these pages from the sitemap by default. When you force-index these pages, they'll get added back to the sitemap.
		* **Nota bene:** This only works when setting a page ID via WooCommerce's settings UI. The setting is accessible via `wc_get_page_id()` (WC 3.0 and later).
	* Resolved a memory leak in image-tooltips.
	* Addressed an issue where image-tooltips don't load correctly when reloading the DOM, such as with our [Local extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/local/).
	* When using WPML, the main sitemap no longer contains "display translatable" post types, and the translated sitemaps no longer contain "not translatable" post types nor untranslated posts from "display translatable" post types.
	* Resolved an issue where excluded post types could still have their search-archives adjusted.
		* The following was done to achieve this (bear with me -- excluding posts from excluded post types... yea):
			1. Post meta cannot be fetched from excluded post types. This prevents "on the site"-queries filtering excluded post-type-posts.
			1. A `LEFT JOIN` ... `WHERE $wpdb->posts.post_type IN ('[post_types,]')` query is now executed for fetching excluded posts, but only when post types are excluded. This type of join should minimize the query impact, because we expect users only to exclude few posts. The parent query should be 'slowest', but most likely cached, so actually 'fastest'.
				* As before, this query is only executed when saving the SEO settings, or when updating/publishing any post or page. The result of the query is stored in a non-expiring "transient" option.
	* Resolved an issue where excluded taxonomies could still have their archives adjusted.
		* This means your 'excluded' posts may still show up in the excluded taxonomies' terms.
	* Resolved an issue where post-link queries via the Block Editor were filtered by post-search exclusions settings.
* **Not fixed:**
	* Polylang transforms (ruins) the home URL, and depending on your Polylang configuration, sitemaps may or may not output as expected. We've been beating this same horse iterably, and our spirit is dying, for their developers have been reluctant to communicate about this hitherto -- even deleting our comments. Luckily, WordPress will eventually support translatable content natively, after which we can all sigh in relief.
		* Briefly, when using Polylang, do not set "URL Modifications" to "The language is set from content"; use any other setting instead. You'll encounter fewer issues, but using any other setting is also much better for SEO regardless.

**For translators:**

* **Added:**
	* A few new strings require translation.
	* You may find a few strings fuzzy because we updated the links to the documentation of Google and Bing.
* **Updated:**
	* Translation POT file.

**For developers:**

* **Option notes:**
	* For `autodescription-site-settings` (constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`):
		* **Changed:**
			* `paged_noindex` now defaults to `0`, from `1`.
			* `oembed_remove_author` now defaults to `1`, from `0`.
			* `sitemap_query_limit` now defaults to `1000`, from `3000`.
		* **Removed:**
			`cache_object`, this value will not be deleted when upgrading to this version for backward-compatible reasons.
				* During a manual option-save, however, this value will vanish.
* **Object notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `\The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Ajax`, private, internal use only.
			* This class is used to handle AJAX requests for The SEO Framework.
			* The methods it contains were moved from `\The_SEO_Famework\Admin_Init` class.
			* This class and its methods are static, and cannot be instantiated.
			* All methods in the class are marked private, and should not be integrated in your software.
			* This class is final, and cannot be extended.
			* The class may contain some filters and actions (callbacks), which are public.
			* This class is autoloaded when admin-ajax requests are recorded. Since we do not handle "nopriv" requests, these are thusly ignored.
		* In preparation [for the UI redesign project](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/projects/7), and to compact the main facade object, these new classes are new and marked as protected; all methods therein can disappear or change behavior without notice:
			* `\The_SEO_Framework\Interpreters\HTML`
			* `\The_SEO_Framework\Interpreters\Form`
			* `\The_SEO_Framework\Interpreters\Markdown`
		* `\The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\PluginTable`
			* This class is used to take care of our implementations for the WordPress plugins overview table.
			* This class is meant to be used internally only.
			* If you wish to decouple our plugin links, you may need to update your filters now (gone are private methods `_add_plugin_action_links()` and `_add_plugin_row_meta()` from `the_seo_framework()`).
* **Method notes:**
	* **For object `\The_SEO_Framework\Load` (`the_seo_framework()`):**
		* **Added:**
			* `array_merge_recursive_distinct()`, a glorified `array_merge()` that allows unlimited multidimensional arrays inputted.
			* `get_current_post_type()`, shorthand for two other methods to (1) get an estimated post type from the front-end query, with page-as-archive support. (2) Also works extensively in the admin area.
			* `generate_robots_meta()`, returns generated robots metadata.
			* `get_image_uploader_form()`, returns image uploader form button.
				* This is an abstraction of the `get_social_image_uploader_form()` and `get_logo_uploader_form()` methods, both now call the new one for it has an interpolable API.
			* `advanced_query_protection()`, returns the `tsf:aqp` meta tag.
				* This tag is used to indicate a malformed query was detected. It's tilt-proof.
			* `render_element`, do not use. Useful for generating meta tags with few inputs. Escapes for you.
				* This method is marked 'protected' for we have other plans with it in the future.
			* `og_updated_time()`, disjointed from `article_modified_time()`, outputs `og:updated_time` meta tag.
			* `get_modified_time()`, returns the modified time of the current post.
			* `init_ajax_actions()`, self explanatory, right?
			* `get_redirect_url()`, returns the redirect URL for the current query. Also accepts arguments.
			* We changed these for get them in sync with post and term meta:
				* `get_user_meta_item()`, replaces the now deprecated `get_user_option()`.
				* `get_current_post_author_meta_item()`, replaces the now deprecated `get_current_author_option()`.
				* `get_current_post_author_meta()`, returns all TSF author metadata.
				* `get_user_meta_defaults()`, replaces the now deprecated `get_default_user_data()`.
		* **Improved:**
			* `can_i_use()`, fixed sorting algorithm from fribbling-me to resolving-me. Nothing changed but legibility.
			* `is_static_frontpage()` now memoizes the front page ID option.
			* `s_image_details()` Fixed theoretical issue where a different image could be set when width and height are supplied and either over 4K, but no ID is given.
			* `get_excluded_ids_from_cache()`
				1. Now tests against post type exclusions.
				2. Now considers headlessness. This method runs only on the front-end.
			* `get_timestamp_format()`:
				1. Added options-override parameter.
				1. Added return value filter.
			* `get_term_meta()` now considers headlessness.
			* `get_post_meta()`:
				1. Now considers headlessness.
				1. now returns an empty array when post type isn't supported. This improvement also affects `get_post_meta_item()`, which will return `null`.
		* **Changed:**
			* `article_modified_time()` no longer outputs `og:updated_time`. Use `og_updated_time()` instead.
			* `robots_txt()`, removed object caching support.
			* `delete_cache()`, the following `$types` are no longer supported: `front`, `post`, `term`, `author`, `robots`, `object`.

				* `generate_front_page_cache_key()`
				* `delete_author_cache()`
			* **Deprecated methods:**

		* `the_seo_framework_enable_noindex_no_posts`, useful for overriding the 404-protection for "empty" archives.
		* `the_seo_framework_timestamp_format`, used to change timestamp formats. [Example usage](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/naver-validation-error-sitemap/#post-14623125). We advise not sending seconds, because small automated atomic-time fixes on your server may cause changes noted unscrupulously.
	* **Changed:**

			* `wp_ajax_tsf_dismiss_notice`
			* `wp_ajax_tsf_update_counter`

= 4.1.3 =

Before heading into 2021, we wanted to [set free four bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3660#detailed).

Pro tip: If you can no longer switch TSF's settings tabs, try hitting 'CMD+OPTION+R' (Safari Mac), 'CMD+SHIFT+R' (Chrome/Firefox Mac) or 'CTRL+SHIFT+R' (Windows); these keyboard shortcuts will force-fetch the latest scripts from your server.

= 4.1.2 =

In this minor update, we ensured compatibility with PHP 8 and WP 5.6. TSF now also fully integrates with WordPress Core Sitemaps, which you can configure via the SEO settings. If you decide to keep using TSF's optimized sitemap, you can now enjoy prerendering, DoS protection, and full Polylang integration. Lastly, you'll find various accessibility improvements, and we fixed [about a dozen bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3650#detailed).

We included a single-line self-destructing notification about our [Cyber Monday sale](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3527). We hope you'll opt to support our continuous efforts. But we're also kindly asking you to understand we must promote our premium extensions to make TSF possible. We are apprehensive about any embedded advertising and self-promotion in the plugin, so we must rely on notifications until a better system is available in WordPress.

= 4.1.1 =

In this major-minor update, we improved browser performance by up to 99% (not a typo) by exchanging over 300 jQuery calls for vanilla JS ones. We also added two new options for oEmbed, freed a dozen bugs that got stuck in the UI and generators, and [improved accessibility](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3623#detailed).

= 4.1.0 - Grace =

*Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light. - [J.K. Rowling &amp; Steve Kloves](https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/harry-potter-and-prisoner-azkaban)*

**Release highlights**

* This update brings you up to 96% faster browser interaction, up to 30% faster browser rendering times, and up to 26% faster server response times.
* You can now use quick-edit to adjust meta titles and descriptions of all your posts and terms.
* New custom taxonomy settings are added, so you can quickly deindex custom taxonomies, or exclude SEO for them entirely.
* Well-known page builders that aren't built upon shortcodes, like Elementor, Beaver Builder, and Siteorigin's, now support meta description generation.
* The description generator is now far more intelligent--it can now recognize contractions, and other complex punctuations and marks (¡¿Que?! Y'all'dn't've!? 「やった！」).
* WordPress 5.5 support is now integrated deeply. To get there, we had to implement new query listeners, browser observers, and persistent notices.

**Graciously graceful**

This update's name is Grace, and for a good reason: the plugin listens to your inputs respectfully and does everything as you incline, as you would expect.

The SEO Framework's response-and rendering times have substantially been reduced; everything's much smoother and swifter since 5 years ago--back when it had fewer than 1&#160;000 users.

At first glance, you probably won't notice anything new after updating to 4.1. But, when you look closer, among 350 QOL changes, you'll find improvements such as:

* Tapping a tooltip no longer accidentally activates related inputs.
* Only necessary REST-requests are made for primary-term support.
* Browser animations execute more naturally, like removing a notification.
* Switching a settings-tab can no longer cause staggered tab-content.
* The description generator now detects deeply nested HTML, improving the accuracy of intent.

You'll also find many obscure new features, such as:

* A new accessible SEO Bar color has been added: Gray. It exclaims there was nothing to process.
* Fancy a custom sitemap stylesheet logo? Now you can upload one.
* You can now remove branding from social meta titles.
* Persistent notices may now show up, gracefully (more on this below).

You can find more than 340 other noteworthy changes in the [detailed log](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3598#detailed).

**Persistent notices**

TSF now stores some notices in your database, so they can be shown to you later, and sometimes even more than once. We call these "persistent notices".

Persistent notices are awfully annoying. We know that. However, since plugin auto-updates are part of WordPress 5.5, we can no longer expect you to invoke an update manually.

These notices are used when we expect them to go unnoticed otherwise--they are conditional, and may only show up when **all** of these conditions are met:

* You have sufficient administrative capabilities or a matching user ID. For example, you must be able to install plugins.
* You are (or aren't) on a specific administrative page. For example, we won't show some notices on the block-editor.
* The time limit hasn't expired. For example, the update-notice won't show up after 7 days from updating.
* The view count hasn't been reached, regardless of who has seen it. For example, we only show some notices 3 times.
* You haven't dismissed it. There's an X-button at the top-right.

If you find a notice reappearing indefinitely, you might have a stubborn caching plugin enabled. So, clear your site's cache.

**Core Sitemaps support**

WordPress 5.5 brings new sitemaps. We added support for them, but we didn't integrate with them. To explain briefly:

* Support: When you enable TSF's sitemap, Core Sitemaps are disabled. When you disable TSF's sitemap, Core Sitemaps will become accessible again.
* Integrate: Core Sitemaps does not listen to the indexing state enforced by TSF. This will cause issues with search engines.

Regardless, we don't believe the Core Sitemaps are beneficial for most WordPress sites. We stubbornly kept our sitemap simple; it's easier for us to maintain and faster search engines to process. Search engines crawl your pages more quickly using TSF's sitemap, no matter your website's size.

Nevertheless, TSF will integrate with Core Sitemaps in a future update. Since we had fewer than two months to anticipate their integration, we couldn't make this happen now.

**Environment upgrade notes**

WordPress 4.9 and 5.0 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Almost 75% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using version 5.1 or later.
* Newer versions of WordPress are faster, more reliable, and easier to work with; for both you and us.
* Supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.

**Support the development**

We hope you'll love this update as much as we do. Please consider supporting us by giving [an awesome review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/reviews/#new-topic-0), [get a license](https://theseoframework.com/pricing/), or convince your friends and colleagues that TSF is amazing!
