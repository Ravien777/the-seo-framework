### We poured over 27&#160;000 hours of love into this plugin. <br>Here are the results:

* **It is brilliant.**
The SEO Framework is an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) for SEO. It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.

* **It comes preconfigured.**
With The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you're not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **It helps you optimize your metadata.**
We made the only SEO plugin that follows Google's webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.

* **It creates a beautiful overview.**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse cursor. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.

* **It includes exceptional support.**
We don't outsource our support. We're here for you. Feel free to drop by [our support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/) at any time to ask a question. More than 1400 inquiries have been answered personally, typically within 48 hours in the past five years.

* **It leaves no room for errors.**
We focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don't. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won't steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.

* **It remains genuine and pure.**
We built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn't be a billboard for our branding. We won't ever change this.

* **It improves search presence.**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search via structured data. It also automatically generates titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines and quickly helps search engines find the website's latest changes via the built-in optimized sitemap.

* **It makes social sharing easy.**
The SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they're shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and Whatsapp.

* **It feels more than accessible.**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.

* **It protects you from mistakes.**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.

* **It follows best-practices and beyond.**
The biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress's API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.

* **It has developers at heart.**
We encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Check out [our API](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82), and feel free to [contribute](https://tsf.fyi/contributing)!

* **It respects your privacy.**
The SEO Framework sends us no information and does not create cookies. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1701#pluginprivacyinformation).

### Unbranded, free and for the professionals

The SEO Framework is a uniquely white label plugin that blends seamlessly into your WordPress dashboard. This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within your WordPress interface. No ads, no nags. Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your website. Note that we output standardized development-comments distinguishing the plugin output in source code. You can remove these with our free [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2301).

### Behind the screens

The SEO Framework works on many things without notifying you, because the best software is fast, nimble, responsive, and should save you precious time. Here are a few things it does behind the screens.

* It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.
* It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.
* It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don't send a 404 response.
* It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.
* It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn't mean they won't use them; only, they won't show them in their search results.
* It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.

### Compatibility

**The SEO Framework supports:**

* Internationalization through WordPress.org. You can [contribute here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription/).

* Right to Left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, etc.), through its interface and metatag generation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads, tracking, bloat, or nags!
This plugin is slim yet all-inclusive. It's 100% freeware, not crippleware.

= Is there a premium version? =

No. We treat this plugin as a premium plugin already.

However, we do offer many free and paid extensions that help support this free plugin. We provide these via our free [Extension Manager plugin](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= Why is there no analytics, tracking, or 404 monitoring? =

SEO experts that use advanced tools such as Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, and Google Analytics prefer using The SEO Framework because it doesn't try to do their job haphazardly.

To correctly analyze your website, it must be done from the outside. If we load these features on your site, bad robots will cause thousands of false positives that fill your database with useless information that doesn't apply to search engines. We refrain from this because it won't ever help you anyway.

= I have a feature request, a question, or found a bug. =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.

We'll try to get back to you within a week. Typically, we reply within three days.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

Learn more [about contributing](https://tsf.fyi/contributing).

= What do the colors tell me? =

We use different colors to convey messages. Red is an error that you must resolve. Yellow is a non-critical warning that you may want to address. Green is good. Blue is informational and situational. Gray is undefined or unprocessable.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, etc. =

Not having every single page listed is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.

If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760). It brings extensions, like [Articles](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2303), that fill in the gaps via modern and more robust means.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option for it. This option will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

In the meantime, you can disable SEO for the unwanted entries via the "General SEO Settings" under "Exclusions."

= Why aren't focus keywords included? =

[Google warns](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/irrelevant-keywords) about the keyword stuffing approach implemented by some other SEO plugins. It forces users to write unnatural content, and it can have adverse effects on your site's ranking.

Modern search engines use AI to understand the context of your articles. This means that as long as you write relevant content, you shouldn't have to worry about keywords.

However, we implemented the same API Google uses to help you find appropriate synonyms and inflections for your keywords. This functionality is part of our premium suite of extensions.

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers that tell search engines how to connect and index the site. We do this via the Schema.org standard.

They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, which social sites you're connected to, and what page structure you're using. This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= How do I display breadcrumbs? =

The SEO Framework outputs hidden breadcrumbs for search engines to find via its Schema.org settings.

You can also output these breadcrumbs visually in your theme by [using a shortcode](https://kb.theseoframework.com/?p=212).

== Changelog ==

### 5.0.5

Highlight: Pinging removal, polylang/wpml sitemap multilingual list in robots.txt for search engines to automatically discover, fixed a bug in Polylang to make every site work more reliably (and to solve the homepage query conflict with TSF). Improved performance (again), and made the sitemap settings easier to understand.

**For everyone**

* **Upgrade:** Now uses TSF version `5050`.
	* The sitemap prerendering option was renamed, since it's no longer bound to the obsolete sitemap pinging functionality.
* **Added:**
	* For Polylang and WPML, the robots.txt output now contains the sitemap URL for every other language. This works when using the URL formats subdirectory, from content, or parameter translation.
		* Subdomain or different domain URL formats already worked as intended, where every subdomain's robots.txt displayed the current language's sitemap URL.
	* Added the `WebSite` type's `alternateName` back to the Schema.org structured data output. This will take the value of the "Organisation or Personal Name" input if it differs from the "Site Title" set at WordPress's General Settings.
	* When the WordPress sitemap is disabled, the endpoints still work and [subsequently performs broken queries](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51117). For these requests, Advanced Query Protection now engages and blocks indexing for these broken queries.
* **Removed:**
	* We've removed the ability to ping the sitemap to Bing and Google because it no longer works. The Bing network's sitemap pinging endpoint was [closed by Microsoft in 2022](https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/may-2022/Spring-cleaning-Removed-Bing-anonymous-sitemap-submission) to propel the IndexNow protocol. We were hopeful that they'd return the pinging functionality, but alas. [Google subsequently closed their endpoint in January 2024](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/06/sitemaps-lastmod-ping). They say they deprecated it, but it simply no longer works, neither for regular sitemaps nor for the Google News sitemaps.
		* The search engines still use the sitemap protocol as before, they only dropped pinging thereof.
		* The search engines read `/robots.txt` and looks for the sitemap's location there. They and all significant search engines automatically read the sitemap periodically without relying on pinging.
		* We have plans to support IndexNow, but for Now, you can Index via IndexNow using the official [IndexNow plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indexnow/). As someone who can distinguish WordPress.com from WordPress.org, we'll bring you a properly programmed version later this year, though likely via a Premium extension.
		* Pinging of the Google News sitemap may still engage via Articles and provoke deprecation notices; we'll remove this in the next update of Extension Manager.
	* bbPress 2.5.14 and below are no longer supported for topic tag title and description generation. Please update to bbPress 2.6.9 or later for the best experience.
		* bbPress 2.6 rectified the query detection, so TSF works automatically with that.
* **Changed:**
	* We now use `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD` instead of `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD` (we added the seconds) for full dates in the sitemap, structured data, and Open Graph.
	* The optimized sitemap now orders hierarchical post types by last modified date instead of first publishing date, akin to how it already ordered nonhierarchical post types.
	* Reduced the default sitemap query limit from 1000 to 250.
		1. This reduces the likelihood of crashes when another plugin hooks into the Post or Post Meta APIs with heavy checks (that ought to be done elsewhere).
		2. We now convey why the optimized sitemap does things differently.
		3. If the user switches to the complex sitemap, then this will help with faster generation of its paginated sitemaps.
		4. Faster generation times look better.
	* You can now opt to prerender the sitemap without opting for pinging via cron... because pinging is no longer possible.
		* This is less effective but should still serve its purpose fine.
* **Improved:**
	* Changed the wording of the link relationship settings to reflect better what they output.
	* Expounded on what the optimized sitemap does, and that disabling the optimized sitemap will give the complex sitemap.
	* Sitemap settings now dynamically display the available features when switching from the Optimized and Core sitemaps.
	* After looking at meetup events about The SEO Framework, we found that experts misinterpreted some of our settings (especially in non-English speaking languages). For those settings, we made our language more plain and clear, and hope this helps translators to better convey our intent.
	* Removed more jQuery dependencies, improving performance slightly of the admin UI.
	* Improved performance of Advanced Query Protection by skipping some repeated tests when the homepage isn't a blog.
	* Processing of Markdown text in the admin area is a tad faster now.
	* The sitemap stylesheet (`/sitemap.xsl`) now has its CSS minified.
* **Fixed:**
	* Addressed an issue where the link relationship settings didn't have an effect.
	* Addressed an issue where a broken homepage-settings-edit-link was given when there isn't a static homepage assigned when the homepage should display a static page.
		* Yes, you can assign a homepage without assigning a homepage, and that's a bug in WordPress where a user assigns a static homepage, and then unpublishes/deletes that page, or the user otherwise only set a posts page.
	* Addressed an issue where the Homepage SEO settings didn't reflect the Page SEO settings when they're set to `0`.
		* Note that a lone `0` for the title (without branding/additions) will bypass WordPress's filters, because WordPress doesn't support a lone `0` for the title. But you should brand your titles.
	* Addressed an issue where the Page SEO settings didn't reflect the Homepage SEO settings when they're set to `0`.
	* Addressed an issue where the homepage wasn't asserted for inclusion in the sitemap via various indexability tests (password, private, draft, noindex, and post exclusion filter tests).
	* Addressed an issue where the posts page wasn't asserted for inclusion in the sitemap via some indexability tests than before (password, private, and draft tests).
	* Addressed an issue where the homepage canonical URL wasn't translated by Polylang.
		* We achieved this by hijacking Polylang's code, fixing [a bug in that plugin](https://github.com/polylang/polylang/issues/1422).
		* This also fixes the bug described below.
	* Addressed an issue where the subdirectory-translation sitemap wasn't accessible via Polylang, such as `/fr/sitemap.xml`.
	* Addressed an issue where TSF would output a deprecation notice when visiting a bbPress topic tag.
	* Addressed an issue where slow requests could be made if a certain post type trait (`hierarchical`, `nonhierachical`) didn't exist. This shouldn't be possible unless posts or pages are unregistered, nor should it be possible because the caches aren't touched more than once per request, but I deemed it a bug nonetheless.
		* Pro tip: Look for logical bugs by tracing your code, rather than solely relying on user feedback. You're lazy (and rich and settled) if you don't revisit your popular code.
	* Addressed a regression where '0' was incorrectly considered a valid post password in the Classic Editor.
* **Other:**
	* WordPress v6.5 will [no longer set pointer-cursors for labels](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59733). Because we use labels for our settings-tabs' buttons and adopted WP's cursor property, we reinstated that property for our tabs.

**For translators**

* **Added:** New translations are available.
* **Updated:** TODO The POT file contains new translations.

**For developers:**

* **PHP method notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* Pool `tsf()->sitemap()->cron()` is now available.
			* It contains method `schedule_single_event()`, which engages all sitemap crons in 29, 30, and 31 seconds.
			* Internally known as `The_SEO_Framework\Sitemap\Cron`.
		* Pool `tsf()->format()->minify()` is now available.
			* It contains methods `javascript()` and `css()`, respectively minifying JS and CSS.
			* Internally known as `The_SEO_Framework\Helper\Format\Minify`.
		* Method `tsf()->uri()->get_generated_paged_urls()` is new.
		* Method `tsf()->query()->utils()->has_assigned_page_on_front()` is new.
		* Method `tsf()->format()->time()->get_format()` is new.
		* Method `tsf()->sitemap()->cache()->get_transient_prefix()` is new.
	* **Changed:**
		* `tsf()->data()->post()->is_password_protected()` now again assumes that `'0'` is an invalid password.
		* `tsf()->query()->utils()->is_query_exploited()` now detects `should_be_404`, specifically for query variable `sitemap` and `sitemap-subtype`.
* **Javascript notes:**
	* Method `tsf.coalesceStrlen()` is now available.
	* Methods `tsfTabs.hideTab()`, `tsfTabs.showTab()`, and `tsfTabs.toggleTab()` are now available.
* **Option notes:**
	* Of option `autodescription-site-settings` (constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`, pool `tsf()->data()->plugin()`, or legacy API `tsf()->get_options()`):
		* Renamed index `ping_use_cron_prerender` to `sitemap_cron_prerender`, which value is migrated during upgrade. Default `0`.
		* Changed index `timestamps_format`: It is now considered a boolean, instead of an integer.
			* We left this as a string to allow more options in the future, but that was never necessary.
		* Removed index `ping_bing`.
		* Removed index `ping_google`.
		* Removed index `ping_use_cron`.
* **Action notes:**
	* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_transient_cleared` no longer provides information in its first parameter.
	* `tsf_sitemap_cron_hook_retry` (cron event) is gone. This hook was used when the pinging cron job failed to complete due to the sitemap still prerendering. It was actually quite ingenius, what we had.
	* `the_seo_framework_before_ping_search_engines` is gone.
	* `the_seo_framework_ping_search_engines` is gone.
* **Filter notes:**
	* `the_seo_framework_extract_content_strip_args` is new. Use this to filter how post content is extracted via the context-sensitive tag stripper `\The_SEO_Framework\Helper\Format\HTML\strip_tags_cs()`.
	* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_throttle_s` is gone.
	* `the_seo_framework_exploitable_query_endpoints`, added index `not_front_page` with values `sitemap` and `sitemap-subtype`.
* **Changed:**
	* Filter `the_seo_framework_sitemap_hpt_query_args`:
		1. Now sets orderby to 'lastmod', from 'date'.
		1. Now sets order to 'DESC', from 'ASC'.
* **Deprecated:**
	* Pool `tsf()->sitemap()->ping()` is now deprecated, and its methods are no longer accessible and return `null`.
	* Protected class `\The_SEO_Framework\Sitemap\Ping` is now gone.
* **Improved:**
	* Incorrectly calling pool methods statically is now handled more gracefully.
		* Do NOT call pools like `tsf()::admin()::layout()::make_single_select_form()`, but use `tsf()->admin()->layout()->make_single_select_form()` instead. Failing to do so might result in a crash once we need to deprecate a call, defeating the purpose of the static deprecator.
* **Fixed:**
	* For method `tsf()->uri()->get_paged_urls()`, reinstated missing option checks.

### 5.0.4

This tiny update [addresses an issue](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4215) that affected detection of the assigned blog page.

### 5.0.3

This minor update fixes compatibility with Polylang Pro. We also perfected the detection of unassigned home and blog pages and improved the Block Editor's load time by [resolving a glitch](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4204).

### 5.0.2

This minor update fixes more issues our community found after the release of TSF v5.0.0. We also improved the calculation of primary terms with child terms and how breadcrumbs handle post type archives. And again, we [improved the performance](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4174).

### 5.0.1

This minor update fixes issues our community found after the release of TSF v5.0.0. We also [improved the performance](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4158).

### 5.0.0 - Apex

*We become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts. - [Aristotle](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3Dpos%3D17%3Asection%3D4)*

**Release highlights**

* There's a brand-new relational Schema.org structured data generator.
* We added a new shortcode (and function) for breadcrumbs to put in your templates.
* You can now select a preferred Twitter Card type for every post, term, and custom post type.
* Do you fancy the SEO Bar but find it distracting? Toggle the new dull, low-contrast color scheme.
* Special characters are now normalized for SEO Bar assertions, so it is now far more accurate.
* Users with an author role anywhere in a multisite network can now have their SEO meta tweaked from any site.
* Tooltip backgrounds and various border accents now adhere to the admin color scheme (once more).

**Apex**

Even though we dubbed TSF v4.2 "perfect," it couldn't be even better because of its legacy codebase. Many features and tweaks weren't possible because those would've created bugs or made maintenance impossible. In v5.0, we overhauled everything while keeping in mind the future. In doing so, we managed to ascend to a new apex, and we can now see the next summit ahead.

Its code is unrecognizable, yet somehow very familiar. TSF v5.0 "Apex" is just the beginning of what comes next, and it won't be downhill from here.

**New breadcrumb shortcode**

You can now use shortcode `&#91;tsf_breadcrumb&#93;`. This shortcode is meant to be implemented in your theme and will output the current breadcrumb. It will listen to your meta title settings. You can learn more about its syntax in our [Knowledge Base about the Breadcrumb shortcode](https://tsf.fyi/kb/a/212).

**Important for developers**

* We refactored the entire codebase in this update -- over 1.20 million characters were written, and over 0.87 million were removed.
* The code counts **1229 registered changes**; we added over 70 new classes, 220 new methods, 20 new filters, and a shortcode.
* For the main object, `tsf()`, we deleted 19 classes, deprecated 388 methods and 1 property, and deleted 110 methods and 10 properties.
* `uid` is now an accepted custom query parameter for almost all meta-generator methods. If your custom filters for TSF act odd on profile pages, [reach out to us in the forums](https://tsf.fyi/support/tsf/new-topic) and show us your code. **We'll fix it for you.**
* So, if you ever used the `the_seo_framework()` or `tsf()` function, you almost certainly will get a deprecation notice. If you need assistance resolving this, please [open a new support topic](https://tsf.fyi/support/tsf/new-topic) and **show us your code**.

**New meta tag generator**

TSF now generates all meta tags via a registry. You can alter the population of the registry via filters `the_seo_framework_meta_generator_pools` and `the_seo_framework_meta_generators`, and you can modify the final registry via filter `the_seo_framework_meta_render_data`. For that, you can [find an example at Github](https://gist.github.com/sybrew/272b746296114cd93c3320e9544a1618).

**New Schema.org graph generator**

We added a new Schema.org structured data generator to TSF. This generator supports every page, post, archive, and custom post type. We built it to be referential and expansive by generating an ID-based graph. For example, if you refer to a Person once, their entity will be put right there, but if you refer to it again, it will use an ID-based reference. This keeps the output code neat and will not waste time generating an entity twice. You can filter it via `the_seo_framework_schema_graph_data`.

**Environment upgrade notes**

WordPress 5.5 through 5.8 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Over 75% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using WordPress v5.9 or later.
* Newer versions of WordPress are faster, more reliable, and easier to work with --- for both you and us.
* Supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.

PHP 7.2 and 7.3 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Almost 80% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using PHP v7.4 or later.
* Newer versions of PHP are faster and more secure. For us, they're also easier to work with.
* Again, supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.
