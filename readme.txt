= We poured over 27&#160;000 hours into this plugin. Here are the results: =

* **It is brilliant.**
The SEO Framework is an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) for SEO. It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.

* **It comes preconfigured.**
With The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you're not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **It helps you optimize your metadata.**
We made the only SEO plugin that follows Google's webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.

* **It creates a beautiful overview.**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse cursor. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.

* **It includes exceptional support.**
We don't outsource our support. We're here for you. Feel free to drop by [our support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/) at any time to ask a question. More than 1400 inquiries have been answered personally, typically within 48 hours in the past five years.

* **It leaves no room for errors.**
We focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don't. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won't steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.

* **It remains genuine and pure.**
We built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn't be a billboard for our branding. We won't ever change this.

* **It improves search presence.**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search, and by automatically generating titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines. It also notifies Google, Bing, and all connected search networks automatically of your website's changes with its built-in sitemap.

* **It makes social sharing easy.**
The SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they're shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and Whatsapp.

* **It feels more than accessible.**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.

* **It protects you from mistakes.**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.

* **It follows best-practices and beyond.**
The biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress's API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.

* **It has developers at heart.**
We encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Check out [our API](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82), and feel free to [contribute](https://tsf.fyi/contributing)!

* **It respects your privacy.**
The SEO Framework sends us no information and does not create cookies. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1701#pluginprivacyinformation).

= Unbranded, free and for the professionals =

The SEO Framework is a uniquely white label plugin that blends seamlessly into your WordPress dashboard. This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within your WordPress interface. No ads, no nags. Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your website. Note that we output standardized development-comments distinguishing the plugin output in source code. You can remove these with our free [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2301).

= Behind the screens =

The SEO Framework works on many things without notifying you, because the best software is fast, nimble, responsive, and should save you precious time. Here are a few things it does behind the screens.

* It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.
* It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.
* It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don't send a 404 response.
* It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.
* It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn't mean they won't use them; only, they won't show them in their search results.
* It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.

= Compatibility =

**The SEO Framework supports:**

* PHP 7.4 and higher.
* WordPress 5.9 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Unicode (UTF-8) character recognition and rendering, including Emoji and CJKV (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese).
* Right to Left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, et al.), through its interface and metatag generation.
* Complete color-vision deficiency accessibility thanks to a carefully picked color scheme.
* Full keyboard navigation, so that you can inspect tooltips quickly without ever having to reach for your mouse.
* Full screen-reader accessibility via field anchors, ARIA labels, and title attributes.
* WordPress Multisite setups, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection and output of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Full integration with WordPress Core sitemaps.
* Primary term (category) selection to influence breadcrumbs and links.
* Output of structured data via Schema.org JSON-LD scripts.
* Altering oEmbed for improved sharing on Discord.
* Detection of various other SEO tools to help you switch graciously.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus, and MultilingualPress.
* E-commerce plugins like WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.
* Forum plugins like bbPress and wpForo.
* Editing posts and terms via WordPress's native bulk-and-quick-edit interfaces.
* Headless mode via a single [constant definition](https://kb.theseoframework.com/?p=136).

= Copyright legislation notice =

In a few words: The SEO Framework allows search engines to do what they've been doing for the past 20 years via its preconfigured copyright settings.

When you activate The SEO Framework on any site, you automatically grant rights to content aggregators, among Google, Bing, and Yandex, to obtain and use information from the site, including written work, images, audio, and video. You can control these rights via the robots-meta settings brought by this plugin. Your rights and the effectiveness of these settings are subject to your website's region and language, and the physical or virtual origin of the platform and their potential users through which your website's information is obtained and shared. It is up to the aggregator to honor your rights and the requests brought via The SEO Framework.

If you wish to learn more, please refer to the [EU commission on copyright](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/modernisation-eu-copyright-rules). These rulings may propagate its effects through regions outside the EU.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads, tracking, bloat, or nags!
This plugin is slim yet all-inclusive. It's 100% freeware, not crippleware.

= Is there a premium version? =

No. We treat this plugin as a premium plugin already.

However, we do offer many free and paid extensions that help support this free plugin. We provide these via our free [Extension Manager plugin](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= Why is there no analytics, tracking, or 404 monitoring? =

SEO experts that use advanced tools such as Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, and Google Analytics prefer using The SEO Framework because it doesn't try to do their job haphazardly.

To correctly analyze your website, it must be done from the outside. If we load these features on your site, bad robots will cause thousands of false positives that fill your database with useless information that doesn't apply to search engines. We refrain from this because it won't ever help you anyway.

= I have a feature request, a question, or found a bug. =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.

We'll try to get back to you within a week. Typically, we reply within three days.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

Learn more [about contributing](https://tsf.fyi/contributing).

= What do the colors tell me? =

We use different colors to convey messages. Red is an error that you must resolve. Yellow is a non-critical warning that you may want to address. Green is good. Blue is informational and situational. Gray is undefined or unprocessable.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, et al. =

Not having every single page listed is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.

If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760). It brings extensions, like [Articles](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2303), that fill in the gaps via modern and more robust means.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option for it. This option will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

In the meantime, you can disable SEO for the unwanted entries via the "General SEO Settings" under "Exclusions."

= Why aren't focus keywords included? =

[Google warns](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/irrelevant-keywords) about the keyword stuffing approach implemented by some other SEO plugins. It forces users to write unnatural content, and it can have adverse effects on your site's ranking.

Modern search engines use AI to understand the context of your articles. This means that as long as you write relevant content, you shouldn't have to worry about keywords.

However, we implemented the same API Google uses to help you find appropriate synonyms and inflections for your keywords. This functionality is part of our premium suite of extensions.

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers that tell search engines how to connect and index the site. We do this via the Schema.org standard.

They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, which social sites you're connected to, and what page structure you're using. This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= I don't see the breadcrumbs! =

The SEO Framework does not provide the display of breadcrumbs. This is theme-territory. This plugin only annotates them for search engines via a JSON-LD script.

If you wish to display breadcrumbs, then your theme should provide this. Alternatively, there are [other plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/breadcrumbs/) that help you do this.

== Changelog ==

TODO highlight in large changes:
	* Color scheme works again for tooltips.
	* Issue with caching plugins and WordPress Core vulnerability yet unresolved?
		* https://wordpress.org/support/topic/meta-block-sometimes-not-inserted/.
		* https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/issues/2217.
		* Also notify Nik via email?
	* Multisite support for author SEO fields.

TODO add toggle for homepage settings where each "language" installed can be altered accordingly.
	-> This requires probably a whole lot more work than I'd have hoped.
	-> This can go wrong if the default language changes, or disappears.
		-> But, this is effectively the same issue we have with Custom Post Type Archives.
			-> Speaking of which, we should also have another of such a switcher for those... ugh.
	-> If we consider this, always have primary site language setting, and store sublanguages under another index.
		-> This will cause issues if the main language changes?
TODO check mail Dean about WPML config

TODO add "disable JIT compiler" option to Description generator?
	- It'll remove some restrictions in PHP at the expense of performance (4x slower, effectively 0.75ms extra load time, so 5% slower overall?)
		* https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-meta-description-for-long-posts/

TODO 'show-if-tsf-js'
	-> Use this to show a "Something went wrong, counters won't load" banner.
		-> "Your site experienced a fatal error."
			-> If current_user_can install plugins, add "You may have received an automated notification email about this. Otherwise, check the PHP error logs for details."

TODO update doc "actions" (also update doc "constants" for TSFEM)

TODO add vertical expand title input?
	-> This helps with Gutenberg's atrocious sidebar.

TODO at "Schema.org Settings", we say "Enable...", "Enable..." and then "Output...".
	-> Use "Output" for anythign that outputs code, and "Enable" for a feature that adjusts already outputted code?

TODO highlight user-edit for multisite? It's quite a feat (user_has_author_info_cap_on_network et al.)
	-> We may want to add "is indexable" on a per-site basis.
		-> Or, otherwise, allow all authors to be indexed on the site.
			"Allow indexing of author pages that have no posts." with a warning.

TODO announce that integers are no longer supported for `$args` in all methods that use `fix_generation_args`
	* Also list all methods affected.
		-> ouchie.

TODO find new public function and filters via @since 5.0.0.*?...
TODO mark subroutine methods in Meta private?

TODO "Note: The input value of this field may be used to describe the name of the site elsewhere."
	-> Tell that it should be the brand name?

TODO update "https://kb.theseoframework.com/kb/data-stored-in-your-database/".

TODO test get_generated_shortlink_url() and URL pagination with multilingual plugins and other odd queries (wpforo et al.) and URL fragments (are there plugins that add these?).
	-> find via wpdirectory.

TODO if we add a new "enable Schema.org output" support button (because it's now always outputting something), we should enable it only if the user has any of the 3 toggles enabled.
	* Or, for new users, always enabled it.

TODO test site without images and where images are all deleted after being set to TSF settings.

TODO can we bust the cache via a JS script if we detect an older version is being requested?
	-> E.g., we flag "expected version" to each script. If it's a mismatch, bust it?

TODO test attachment pages' breadcrumb (and image data etc.).
	-> Everything's OK, but:
	-> FIXME: The placeholder description doesn't reflect the "alternative text" we're using.
		-> Make issue. This isn't important right now.

TODO we MUST add a new option for Schema.org
	-> Shall we add subsequent toggles, for each type?
		-> Shall we add more input fields for the user to tweak?
			-> Shall we make a single overview, isntead of making it tabular?
				-> And then, shall we make the URL input fields incremental, and collapse all stored URL fields that exist into them?

TODO when loading Gutenberg, the title is prefilled with "Untitled" -- is this intentional?
	-> It looks jarring on a slow connection.

TODO get_post/term/user_meta -> add to legacy api?

TODO instead of removing Elementor library from public posts types, force noindex on them?
	-> Because we already excluded them, they're unlikely to be found by crawlers, though.
	-> Having them still included will add a bunch of metadata fields to the admin; perhaps we should allow them on the front-end, and noindex them on the back-end?
		-> Or we could use wp_robots filters? It's their mess, though.

TODO list all new public classes and their methods in the changelog.
	-> i.e. those without @access private

TODO tell in KB that "The language is set from content" in "Polylang -> Settings -> URL Modifications" should not be used.
	-> get_locale() doesn't respect language changes.
	-> All others settings work fine.

TODO add settings check  wp_attachment_pages_enabled (the attachments are still "public")
	See https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/

TODO since we now sanitize images when we obtain then, we may accidentally fetch duplicates.
	-> When more than one image is obtained by the generator, filter it against the stack:
		1. Match duplicated URLs and strip if found.
			array_unique( array_filter( array_column( $cleaned_details, 'url' ) ) )
		2. Match duplicated IDs and strip if found; note that 0 === 0 and 0 == false, so don't use this:
			array_unique( array_filter( array_column( $cleaned_details, 'id' ) ) )

TODO make issue: We should upgrade the twitter profile inputs to become fully qualified URLs.
	-> We can then use these inputs for the knowledge graph more easily, and extract the handle from the URI for Twitter Card.

TODO use the word "robust" and "lightweight" and "unbranded" in our intro?

For the filter, we should promote using:
add_filter(
	'the_seo_framework_meta_render_data',
	function ( $tags_render_data ) {

		$tags_render_data['robots']['attributes']['content'] = 'index';

		$tags_render_data['twitter:description']['attributes']['content'] = 'hello world!';

		$tags_render_data['my-custom-tag'] = [
			'attributes' => [
				'test' => 'some-exmaple-stuff',
				'id'   => 'mytagid',
			],
			'tag'        => 'example', // The tag name.
			'content'    => 'Some content', // The tag content. Leave this out to create a void tag.
		];

		return $tags_render_data;
	},
);

TODO highlight that `uid` is accepted as an argument. In rare circumstances, if the homepage is a blog, this may cause issues with forward compatibility.

TODO when og tags are hidden, the Twitter tags fields should not fall back to them.
	-> They don't on the front-end, but do in the back-end.
	-> This is even more tricky when considering Homepage and PTA settings...

TODO Note that this plugin now boots up twice as fast as before.
TODO Note that this plugin generates data twice as fast as before
	-> This assumes we have Structured Data disabled, which doubled the processing requirement (hence, we're back at ~the same performance).
		-> Let's get the real data.
	-> We must still implement new metadata generation memoizers.
		-> Once that's implemented, it should be over twice as fast.
			-> Practically, we could add memoization whenever `$args` is `null`.

**Detailed log**

**For everyone:**

* **Added:**
	* **Structured data:**
		* The Schema.org structured data generator has been upgraded to output graphs instead of simple, separated scripts.
			* The way we've implemented it is faster and robust than ever before, and it finally allows for rapid implementation for new types. This also means that we had to abandon all filters (see the developer notes far below).
				* TODO: It may not be as fast as before in net, because we output much more data.
					-> Resolve this by memoizing descriptions and titles and URLs?
						-> 5.0.1?
		* Because the data is much more expansive, we've added a new toggle to enable all structured data.
			* This toggle is enabled by default for all new users of TSF.
			* This toggle is enabled for existing users if Sitelinks Search Box, Authorized Presence, or Breadcrumbs were enabled.
		* We reintroduced the connected social networks interface for Schema.org.
			* We still do not believe this is helpful for ranking. However, there's little harm done in having it.
		* `Schema.org/WebSite` is now added to every page.
			* `Schema.org/Organization` is added to this if the site represents an organization.
			* `Schema.org/Person` is added to this if the site represents a person.
		* `Schema.org/WebPage` is now added to every page but 404. TODO confirm
			* `Schema.org/BreadcrumbList` is added to this.
			* Schema.org/Author is added to this if there's an author registered to the post. TODO confirm
		* `Schema.org/BreadcrumbList` has been rewritten and is now supported on all types of pages, not just singular posts.
	* **Breadcrumbs:**
		* HTML breadcrumb output is now supported. Since it appears they aren't coming anytime soon to the Block editor.
			* You can use the shortcode, `[tsf_breadcrumb]`, which will output a breadcrumb for the current request.
			* Here are all default attributes; it's equivalent to the one above: `[tsf_breadcrumb sep="\203A" home="Home" class="tsf-breadcrumb"]`.
				* `sep` is the separator. This is outputted via CSS content, so you mustn't use HTML.
				* `home` is the homepage's name. This is translatable by default.
				* `class` is the CSS class for the breadcrumbs. This must be a valid class, or only the first few acceptable letters are chosen. When the entire classname is invalid, it'll fall back to `tsf-breadcrumb`.
			* You can filter the attributes using filter `shortcode_atts_tsf_breadcrumb`.
			* You can filter the CSS using filter `the_seo_framework_breadcrumb_shortcode_css`.
			* You can filter the output using filter `the_seo_framework_breadcrumb_shortcode_output`.
	* **Twitter Card:**
		* You can now override the default Twitter Card type for the homepage, and every post, term, and post type archive.
			* Yes, it's still called Twitter Card, which is used for X and Discord.
	* **Multisite:**
		* On multisite, you can now inspect and edit user SEO metadata ("Authorial Info") for any users that have author capabilities on any (other) blog.
			* This capability is by default `edit_posts`, predefineable via constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_AUTHOR_INFO_CAP`.
		* When switching blogs on multisite, all data memoization now flushes.
	* **Migration:**
		* SEOPress's metadata is now detected when activating the plugin for the first time, so TSF can suggest to [migrate SEO metadata](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/transport/).
	* **Third party support:**
		* This plugin can now be updated via [GitHub Plugin Updater](https://git-updater.com/knowledge-base/general-usage/).
	* **Accessibility:**
		* You can now opt to use a low contrast color pallete for the SEO Bar.
			* We are aware this should be [configurable via the device settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast), but this standard is inconsistent. Besides, giving an option allows any site owner to set a preference.
			* The color red will still jump out, this is because we use red to convey something must be fixed. All other colors will look faded and less distracting.
	* **Performance:**
		* All data fetchers use new memoization techniques that can hold data for up to 69 posts, terms, and users each (nice!). Whenever this number is exceeded in a single request, TSF maintains the first 7 entries and forgets the rest, assumning those first 7 are part of the initial request. This prevents excessive database lookups, data sanitization, etc., even beyond what we already did (only the last one requested was remembered).
* **Changed:**
	* TSF no longer pings search engines the base sitemap location when updating the options without changing the options.
	* **Compatibility:**
		* TSF now requires WordPress v5.9 or later, from WordPress v5.5 or later.
		* When no proper Shop page is assigned in WooCommerce, TSF will now correctly treat the shop page as a Post Type Archive.
			* In doing so, we removed the "Archives: " prefix. We find it an illogical addition for this post type specifically.
	* **Accessibility:**
		* The Homepage SEO Settings box's title no longer carries a warning; instead, we added a bigger, more noticable warning to every settings section when editing the homepage.
			* We're getting too many support inquiries about this; sorry about the noise, but it ought to decrease confusion.
			* This also works around an issue where Gutenberg still doesn't understand HTML.
			* This also works around an issue where Gutenberg leadership does not respect the community that allowed them to create the everlasting abomination and [fix all the points made here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/7960), which would take about 5 hours of work -- postponed for 5 years already.
	* **Meta tags:**
		* The `theme_color` metatag now also outputs on requests where Advanced Query Protection engages.
		* `article:modified_time` and `article:published_time` now listen to Open Graph settings, and will always try to output on single post types.
		* The description generator no longer uses the blog tagline for the homepage, it's often too short anyway.
		* Paginated URLs are now outputted regardless of indexation status a custom canonical URL being present.
			* This helps search engines find URLs to all paginated pages, improving link discovery.
		* The shortlink URL is now also outputted on the paginated homepage.
	* **Administration:**
		* When previewing a post, you may now be redirected when a custom redirect is entered in the meta.
		* On various places where we mentioned Twitter, we now mention X. This is done sporadically, perhaps seemingly inconsistent, because we use "Twitter Card tags for X."
	* The plugin compatibility loader now tests common filenames instead of function, constant, or class' presence.
	* When activating or deactivating the plugin, only on WordPress 6.4 or later the options will now toggle from autoloading on and off.
		* It will still toggle on for older versions of WordPress.
	* When a dropdown option fails sanitization, it will revert back to the last known option, instead of an arbitrary default.
	* We no longer allow unregistered settings to be stored in TSF's option meta. During the upgrade, all unregistered settings will be deleted automatically as a side-effect of registering new defaults.
* **Improved:**
	* **Administration:**
		* You can now store lone `0`'s as titles and descriptions, and those will be outputted as-is on the front-end.
			* If the title is unbranded, WordPress will replace the title.
			* No one should make use of this feature. It serves as a flex that our data handling is super robust.
		* You can now store ampersands (`&`), slashes (`/`), and backward solidus (`\`) in titles and descriptions without the risk of them being lost, changed, or duplicated on (a repeated) save.
			* Much work has been done in previous updates to prevent this issue, but we're now certain this is robust.
	* **Localization:**
		* Repeated spacing in metadata are now replaced using the same space character inputted, instead of a default space character.
	* **Performance:**
		* The plugin is faster now due to [new](https://twitter.com/SybreWaaijer/status/1654101713714831361) [coding](https://twitter.com/SybreWaaijer/status/1678409334626172928) [standards](https://twitter.com/SybreWaaijer/status/1678412864200093696) (among others).
		* Multiple types of homepages are no longer tested when fetching custom metadata, improving performance when viewing the administrative post list.
		* The main query is no longer performed by WordPress when loading the sitemap, removing 10 redundant database queries.
			* Related Core ticket is [#51117](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51117).
		* Sticky posts are no longer calculated when generating the sitemap, removing a redundant database query.
			* Related Core ticket is [#51542](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51542).
		* The URL generator has been rewritten from the ground up. With that, we removed all patches for pagination and rely on our pagination tweaks now.
			* Because of this, the sitemap generates up to 4% faster, even after we applied a URL sanitizer patch.
				TODO retest versus feb1ab3 -- we're bound to \tsf()-> functionality yet.
		* The Shortlink generator has been rewritten. It no longer generates the URL before it determines it could actually use it. It also uses a much more straightforward method to append the query parameters.
		* The Image generator has been rewritten. It now only feeds data when an actual image is found; this reduces operation feedback in subroutines, improving performance significantly.
		* The main object in the plugin has been largely emptied, and is over TODO methods lighter. Or, more importantly, TODO lines of code (including comments) smaller.
			* Now, depending on the options you use and which page one visits, selectively, the required methods are loaded, reducing read times of the plugin files by about 70% (TODO confirm "boot").
			* Now, the main object is rarely required internally, but most methods are called statically (directly). This reduces the function overhead [from 4% to 62%](https://3v4l.org/J00A0).
				* Although, this may increase overhead by 17% due to [a quirk in PHP](https://twitter.com/SybreWaaijer/status/1703077875988009325). But, we combat this by creating as few methods as possible, at the cost of "readability" (this only affects developers not using a modern code editor).
		* Generated image metadata are now cached per method using PHP 8's "Fiber" principle (I backported it conceptually to 7.4). This way, the generation of image metadata no longer relies on the type of image requested (Twitter, Open Graph, Structured Data), but may always benefit from already generated image metadata, and continue to make more metadata when there's demand.
		* Fewer term and post meta data is stored in the plugin's memoization (up to 69 items each, nice), so there's less of a strain on memory when generating sitemaps or walking through metadata. Object caching can still work and won't be affected.
		* The SEO Bar no longer asserts the length of every word in a description but only those that are encountered too often, speeding up post list performance significantly.
		* The description generator no longer tries to find the first character separator recursively when there are none.
	* **Compatibility:**
		* A new multilingual plugin conflict detection is implemented. Polylang, WPML, TranslatePress, and WPGlobus are detected by default as potentially conflicting. When a potentially conflicting multilingual plugin is detected:
			* A warning is displayed above the homepage settings.
			* A warning is displayed above the Post Type Archive settings.
			* A warning is displayed at the Sitemap Output settings.
		* When another SEO plugin is active, and you activate a plugin, now a persistent notice is outputted to warn that you shouldn't mix SEO plugins.
			* This notice is shown at most 3 times, to admins that can activate plugins, on the edit, edit-tags, plugins, dashboard, or The SEO Framework settings screens.
			* This notice will clear when you deactivate a plugin, or when it has been shown 3 times.
		* Breadcrumbs of TSF are no longer disabled on WooCommerce product pages. This is because our new script ID can no longer conflict at Google.
			* WooCommerce apparently also made changes to prevent the likelihood for conflicts.
		* We no longer remove "All" languages from WPML when editing the SEO Settings -- in the past it caused querying issues.
	* **Accessibility:**
		* The Custom Post Type Archive selector now better conveys that it's not an option.
		* When resetting the SEO Settings, a clearer change-notice is sent.
		* When disabling Open Graph meta tags, the Post Dates tab will now disappear.
		* When disabling Facebook, Twitter, or oEmbed meta tags, their namesake tab will now disappear.
		* When disabling Open Graph, Facebook, Twitter, and oEmbed meta tags, the Social Title and Social Image settings will now disappear.
		* When disabling the Website logo, the input form is now hidden.
		* When disabling Authorized presence, all its related settings are now hidden.
	* **Redirects:**
		* When an invalid URL is supplied by the admin in the redirect field, the plugin now displays a generic HTTP error code 400 (Bad Request), instead of showing the page.
	* **Other:**
		* Touched up Link's face.
* **Fixed:**
	* Even if WordPress can't fulfill a JSON-type request, WordPress will falsely report it's parsing JSON-formatted content. Caching plugins ignore this, and create a copy of this JSON-type response as a regular page, with the content altered -- [learn more](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/meta-block-sometimes-not-inserted/#post-16559784). TSF no longer stops outputting SEO metadata when a JSON-type is requested by a visitor, so caching plugins won't accidentally store copies without metadata any longer.
		* Akin to `is_admin()`, unexpected behavior will occur in WordPress, themes, and plugins when sending JSON headers. We deem this a security issue, although Automattic thinks differently (hence, Jetpack is still vulnerable to `/?_jsonp=hi`, and so are hundreds of other plugins). Because we treated this as a security issue, we had to wait for Automattic to report back.
		* We consider the following WordPress API functions dangerous, and we advise security researchers investigating plugins utilizing these:
			- `wp_is_json_request()`
			- `wp_is_jsonp_request()`
			- `wp_is_xml_request()`
	* **Administration:**
		* Tooltip text is now more specifically colored white, making text legible again with some custom admin themes.
		* Addressed a regression from TSF v4.2.0 where WordPress admin color schemes stopped affecting TSF's color scheme. Affected are:
			* Tooltip background and text color.
			* Post/Page SEO Settings active-tab border color.
		* Title and description lengths are now calculated more quickly and more accurately for the SEO Bar.
		* Dashlane is being decadent by first removing a perfectly good desktop app, and then they quickly stopped adhering to agreed upon web accessibility standards. Since, it is trying to shove their own "standard" down our throats. We won't mention that "standard," for no one should use it.
			* You should try Nordpass, for Dashlane's incompetence [shall not pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xYXUeSmb-Y).
		* The SEO Settings meta box is now also styled correctly inside the Block Editor for other post types than 'post' when positioned under the content.
			* Most notably, the padding and border around the settings make it much easier on your eyes.
		* If a custom social image URL is inserted in the homepage post-edit meta box, it will now also be depicted in the Homepage Settings meta box on the SEO Settings page.
		* Resolved an issue where the homepage's Post SEO Settings "Remove the site title?" automatically got checked after updating the page. Even though this hadn't an effect on the output, switching the homepage would cause unwonted and unanticipated behavior.
		* Resolved an issue where an asynchronous update state (such as changing counter types) would seem to load infinitely, but it should've actually indicated updating has failed.
		* Resolved an issue where special characters in the site title couldn't be recognized as a match for title branding. For example, a `'` didn't match up to a `&amp;#39;`, `&amp;apos;`, `&amp;#X27;`, or `&amp;#x00000000027;`, while they're all considered equal once rendered.
		* Updated the Google Search Console verification ID link; their redirect to the new endpoint wasn't correct.
	* **Title:**
		* Resolved an issue where the Twitter title would fall back to a custom Open Graph title when Open Graph is disabled.
		* Resolved an issue where the incorrect Open Graph fallback title was proposed as a placeholder in the admin interface.
	* **Description:**
		* Resolved an issue where the Twitter description would fall back to a custom Open Graph description when Open Graph is disabled.
		* Words with attached plain connector punctuation (`l'apostrophe`) now get tested correctly for repeated words.
		* Words with attached plain connector punctuation (`l'apostrophe`) are now considered starting or mid-sentence words, so the `l'`-part of `l'apostrophe` will also be included in the description when it's at the start, and the `apostrophe` part won't be trimmed anymore if not followed by at least 2 more words or final punctuation (dot).
		* Resolved an issue where the description generator didn't recognize non-closing element tags in unescaped attributes.
			* `<el attr="test>">content<el>` must match `content`, not `">content`.
		* Resolved an issue where the description generator didn't recognize second or later unclosed attributes in an element.
			* `<el attr attr="test> test=">content<el>` must match `content`, not ` test=">content`.
		* Resolved an issue where the description would face catastrophic backtracking when stacking elements never closed all.
			* `<el 1><el 2></el> ... never close el 1` should match the entire document, instead of halting the process.
		* Resolved an issue that when the description generator found a similar unclosed element in a stack, it'd consider it as the beginning of the stack.
			* `<element><element></element></never-closing-element>etc...` matched `<element></element></never-closing-element>etc...` but now matches the second `<element>` as content (which will then be obliterated in the second pass).
	* **Compatibility:**
		* Fixed a [bug in Polylang](https://github.com/polylang/polylang/issues/928) that breaks all plugins but Yoast SEO and achieves nothing but slowing down your site -- simply, by purging Polylang's egregious AJAX-handler from browser memory.
		* Fix an issue where the sitemap was invalidated when a URL adds special query parameters with non-latin characters.
	* **Shortlink:**
		* The shortlink can now generate a proper tag URL. WordPress created a different endpoint for this, unlike any other taxonomy.
	* **Headless mode:**
		* Primary terms are now ignored when `meta` is headless.
	* **oEmbed:**
		* Resolved an issue where, when Open Graph meta tags were disabled, the oEmbeds would still take Open Graph titles.
			* We added a tooltip to the option to explain it will fall back to the meta title if the Open Graph title is unavailable.
* **Removed:**
	* The following plugins are no longer recognized as conflicting plugins:
		* SEO: Yoast SEO Premium (Yoast SEO needs to be active for Yoast SEO Premium to work).
			* Yoast SEO is still checked for.
		* Sitemaps: Simple Wp Sitemap ([abandoned](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-wp-sitemap/)).
	* Open Graph tag `og:updated_time` is no longer outputted, it is inferred from `article:modified_time`.
	* Facebook's App ID is no longer available. You may get warnings in Facebooks debugger about this, which you can safely ignore (Facebook doesn't use this tag any longer, and their debugger is outdated).

**For translators:**

* **Added:** New translation strings are available.
* **Updated:** TODO A new POT file is available.

**For developers:**

* TODO: **Plugin database version is now at `5001`**
* **Added:**
	* Pooled objects: TODO order alphabetically (also in code)
		* We do not use pools internally (we call the query-methods directly) -- however, we **urge you to use the pool**. This is because it has a neat little feature: **Dynamic deprecation**. Whenever we choose to remove a method or property you used, your site won't crash when you update the plugin -- instead, you get a deprecation notice and a temporary fallback value.

			* Internally known as `The_SEO_Framework\Data\Post`.
* **Improved:**
	* Method `tsf()->__set()` now protects against fatal errors on PHP 8.2 or later.
	* Usage of stopwatch `microtime()` has been exchanged for `hrtime()`, improving accuracy and performance.
	* Deprecation and inaccessible property/method notices now ***absolutely accurately***&trade; find the originating caller.
	* Query error notices also now ***absolutely accurately***&trade; find the originating caller, in reverse order.
	* `0` should be allowed as a custom social/meta title and description now. Use `\The_SEO_Framework\coalesce_strlen()` to test.
	* Options are no longer fetched twice every admin request to see if they still need to be registered, but instead always use our memoization engine when possible.
		* We offloaded this checking to the setup, so it only checks once (ever) per WordPress site.
* **Changed:**
	* When `tsf()` or `the_seo_framework()` are called too early (before `plugins_loaded`), they'll return a silencer class.
	* Title overwriting is now engaged at `template_redirect`, instead of at `plugins_loaded`. This also tests for query support, so filtering `the_seo_framework_query_supports_seo` now affects titles.
		* This means that some plugins will have their title filters discarded once again. However, reenabling support for this is now much easier.
	* Twitter cards are no longer validated whether a card type is provided.
		* Hence, returning an empty string to (TODO deprecated?) filter `'the_seo_framework_twittercard_output'` will no longer disable Twitter cards.
	* When scripts are enqueued, it is now automatically determined whether late-enqueuing in the footer is necessary.
	* **Generation arguments:**
		* Generation arguments for getting titles, descriptions, canonical URLs, etc., now support `'tax'` instead of `'taxonomy'`.
		* We also added support for `'uid'`, which stands for "User ID," provisioned to become fully embraced in a future update. This is used sparingly and shouldn't be relied on just yet. We have implemented checks against this parameter for forward compatibility.
	* Script templates no longer forward arguments by name, but put them sequentially in variable `$view_args` instead.
	* Almost all of the plugin's data is now sanitized when using the WordPress option or meta APIs, instead of only when using TSF's APIs. The exception is post metadata, which we'll address next major update ([learn more](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/185)).
		* Migration plugins might be affected if they use the default WordPress option/meta API calls that invoke any of these hooks:
			* `'sanitize_option_' . THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`,
			* `'sanitize_term_meta_' . THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_TERM_OPTIONS`.
			* `'sanitize_user_meta_' . THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_USER_OPTIONS`.
* **Fixed:**
	* Resolved PHP warning when editing a post type with altered term type availability.
	* Resolved PHP warning when editing a user with editor capabilities on the primary network's site via WordPress Multisite user-edit interface.
	* The `<font>` tag is deprecated, so we updated the tag and its to `<span>` in the debug panels.
		* These Easter eggs were fun while they lasted.
	* Resolved an issue where Post Type Archive metadata could still be obtained after the post type is set to not be supported by TSF.
* **Option notes:**
	* For option index `autodescription-site-settings` (constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`):
		* **Added:**
			* Index `auto_description_html_method`, this used to be `auto_descripton_html_method` (typo).
			* Index `ld_json_enabled`, this is used to toggle all Schema.org option generation.
		* **Changed:**
			* The options no longer have their slashes stripped via `stripslashes_deep`. This was done precautionary because WordPress adds slashes to everything to account for a long-discouraged PHP quirk. Resaving the options would then cause slashes to become repeated: `'` becomes `\'`, `\'` becomes `\\\'`, etc. This is now addressed.
				* WordPress addressed this issue in their [options API](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/6.3.1/src/wp-admin/options.php#L320), about which I was unaware.
				* See https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-magic-quotes-gpc.php.
		* **Removed**
			* Index `auto_descripton_html_method`.
				* It is now `auto_description_html_method` (typo in "description").
				* We found no indication this was used in public yet, so we didn't go through a deprecation process. Sorry in advance if this change affects your site.
			* Index `knowledge_gplus`.
				* It's no longer supported since 2018; we kept it around because users could fill whatever URL in this field. But, it's time to say goodbye to this cruft.
			* Index `facebook_appid`.
				* Facebook no longer uses this, nor should you.
	* For option index `autodescription-updates-cache` (constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_CACHE`):
		* It's now `autodescription-site-cache` and its contents will be migrated after updating.
			* This option will now also be home to the Archive and Search Exclusion cache.
		* This option will be **removed** on upgrade. If you downgrade, it will be repopulated, and there should be no issues with that.
* **Meta notes:**
	* For term index `autodescription-term-settings` (constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_TERM_OPTIONS`):
		* Although the options were properly unslashed by WordPress, we did nothing of the like for terms. Now, term data is unslashed before saving, for both regular term and quick-edit saving. This means `\` will remain `\`, and won't become `\\` ad infinitum.
	* For the post meta:
		* Just like with term meta, you can now store backward solidi (`\`) without breakage.
	* All meta generation methods are now assumed to return (pre-)sanitized data. You must still escape the data when printing to screen.
* **Transient notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* Transient `tsf_sitemap_{$sitemap_id}_{$revision}_{$blog_id}_{$locale}` may now be stored for sitemaps.
	* **Removed:**
		* Transient `tsf_sitemap_5_%`, where % doesn't contain the sitemap ID, but changes per blog ID and language, is no longer used. This transient should clear automatically.
		* Transient `tsf_exclude_1_%`, where % changes per blog ID and language, is no longer used. This transient will be deleted on upgrade.
		* Transient `tsf_exclude_0_%` was leftover from TSF 3.0 and will be deleted on upgrade.
* **Function notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `tsf_breadcrumb()` is now available. This outputs the breadcrumb for the current page. This is the callback function for shortcode `[tsf_breadcrumb]`.
			* Its attributes (first argument) are filterable via `shortcode_atts_tsf_breadcrumb`.
		* `The_SEO_Framework\is_headless()` is now available. Use this in favor of `\tsf()->is_headless`, which is now deprecated.
		* `The_SEO_Framework\normalize_generation_args()` is now available.
		* `The_SEO_Framework\get_query_type_from_args()` is now available. This is to quickly determine the type from all generation arguments.
		* `The_SEO_Framework\coalesce_strlen()` is now available. This is to quickly determine if a string has length, or coalesce otherwise.
	* **Changed:**
		* `tsf()` and `the_seo_framework()` will now always return TSF's object -- even if the plugin isn't fully initialized. We can now do this because the hook loader has been moved from the class instance.
* **Object notes:**
	* **New objects:**
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Cache` is new. It provides a collection of static caching interface methods. TODO make this private or add a functional EP interface?
	* **Deprecated objects:**
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\Bridges\Scripts` is now deprecated. Use `The_SEO_Framework\Admin\Script\Loader` instead. TODO add a functional EP? e.g. `tsf()->scripts()`
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Scripts` is now deprecated. Use `The_SEO_Framework\Admin\Script\Registry` instead. TODO add a functional EP? e.g. `tsf()->scripts()`
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\Interpreters\SEOBar` is now deprecated. Use `The_SEO_Framework\Admin\SEOBar\Builder` instead. TODO add a functional EP? e.g. `tsf()->seobar()`
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Sitemap\Main` is now deprecated. Use `The_SEO_Framework\Sitemap\Optimized\Main` instead.
			* However, nothing useful is left in this class. TODO add a functional EP? e.g. `tsf()->sitemap()->store()` and `tsf()->sitemap()->registry()`.
	* **Removed objects:**
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Images` is now gone without deprecation.
			* It was a helper class with complex generators. We doubt anyone used this directly.
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Sitemap\Main` is now gone. It was deprecated since TSF 4.2.0.
	* **Existing objects:**
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\Internal\Debug` is now marked private. It was never meant to be public.
		* For class `The_SEO_Framework\Load` (callable via `tsf()` and `the_seo_framework()`):
			* **This class can no longer be instantiated via the new keyword.**
			* **Methods added:**
				* `get_instance()`. But you should use `tsf()` instead.
			* **Methods ennobled:** These are now part of the legacy API and will be maintained indefinitely.
				* `get_option()`
				* `get_options()` (new!)
				* `update_option()`
				* `get_title()`
				* `get_open_graph_title()`
				* `get_twitter_title()`
				* `get_description()`
				* `get_open_graph_description()`
				* `get_twitter_description()`
				* `get_canonical_url()`
				* `get_image_details()`
				* `load_admin_scripts()` (new!)
					* However, consider filtering `the_seo_framework_register_scripts` instead.
				* `print_seo_meta_tags()` (new!)
			* **Methods changed:**
				* TODO redo this list; just go by all functions within the object, ought to be easier retroactively...
				* `query_supports_seo()`
					1. Removed detection for JSON(P) and XML type requests, because these cannot be assumed as legitimate.
					2. Added `is_customize_preview()` as unsupported.
					3. Moved to `The_SEO_Framework\Helper\Query`.
					4. Also removed detection of `wp_doing_ajax()` and `wp_doing_cron()`, this is now being handled by `_init_tsf()`.
				* `_init_sitemap()` is no longer called act action `template_redirect`, but at `parse_request` at priority `15`, now using callback `[ Sitemap\Registry::class, '_init' ]`. This prevents loading the main query.
					* This makes loading the sitemap anywhere from barely noticeable to thousands of times faster, depending on which other plugins and themes you have installed.
					* This new method is still marked as private; I just wanted to document how a part prone to causing catastrophe has changed.
				* `escape_description()` now requires a first parameter.
				* `s_excerpt()` now requires a first parameter.
				* `s_excerpt_raw()` now requires a first parameter.
				* `escape_title()` now requires a first parameter.
				* `is_profile_edit()` now also tests network admin profile screens.
				* `s_min_max_sitemap()`:
					1. Now also sanitizes the default fallback value.
					2. No longer falls back to the default option, but 1000 instead.
				* `s_image_preview()` now falls back to `'large'` instead of `'standard'`.
				* `s_left_right()` no longer falls back to option or default option, but a language-based default instead.
				* `s_twitter_card()` no longer falls to the default option, but `'summary_large_image'`.
				* `get_title()`'s third parameter is now gone. Use `get_open_graph_title()` or `get_twitter_title()` instead.
			* **Methods deprecated:**
				* `set_transient()`, use WordPress's builtin namesake instead.
				* `get_transient()`, use WordPress's builtin namesake instead.
				* `is_404`, use WordPress's builtin namesake instead.
				* `is_admin()`, use WordPress's builtin namesake instead.

		* `the_seo_framework_use_facebook_tags`, use `the_seo_framework_meta_generator_pools` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_use_twitter_tags`, use `the_seo_framework_meta_generator_pools` instead.

		* `the_seo_framework_fetched_description_excerpt`, use `the_seo_framework_description_excerpt` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_manipulate_title`, use `the_seo_framework_overwrite_titles` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins_type`, use `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_twittercard_output`, with no alternative available.
		* `the_seo_framework_generated_archive_title`, use `the_seo_framework_generated_archive_title_items` instead.
	* **Removed:**
		* Deprecated in TSF v4.2.0, two years later, we've now removed these filters:
			* `the_seo_framework_pta_title`
			* `the_seo_framework_the_archive_title`
			* `the_seo_framework_generated_archive_title_prefix`
			* `the_seo_framework_load_options`
			* `the_seo_framework_pta_description`
			* `the_seo_framework_pre`, use action `the_seo_framework_before_meta_output` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_pro`, use action `the_seo_framework_after_meta_output` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_before_output`, use action `the_seo_framework_before_meta_output` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_after_output`, use action `the_seo_framework_after_meta_output` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_settings_capability`, assign constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SETTINGS_CAP` instead.
		* Because we've refactored the plugin detection system, the following filters weren't compatible and thus removed:
			* `the_seo_framework_seo_plugin_detected`, use `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_og_plugin_detected`, use `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_twittercard_plugin_detected`, use `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_ldjson_plugin_detected`, use `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_plugin_detected`, use `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_multilingual_plugin_detected`, use `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins` instead.
		* Because we've rewritten the Structured Data API from the ground up, these were incompatible and thus removed:
			* `the_seo_framework_receive_json_data`, use `the_seo_framework_schema_graph_data` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_use_breadcrumb_seo_title`, use title settings instead.
				* We may in the future add options to adjust the breadcrumb titles on a per-page/term basis.
			* `the_seo_framework_knowledge_logo`, use `the_seo_framework_image_generation_params` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_ld_json_breadcrumb_taxonomies`, use `the_seo_framework_breadcrumb_list` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_ld_json_breadcrumb_terms`, use `the_seo_framework_breadcrumb_list` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_json_breadcrumb_output`, use `the_seo_framework_breadcrumb_list` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_json_search_output`, use `the_seo_framework_schema_graph_data` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_json_knowledge_output`, use `the_seo_framework_schema_graph_data` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_auto_descripton_html_method_methods`
			* It is now `the_seo_framework_auto_description_html_method_methods` (typo in "description").
			* We found no indication this was used in public yet, so we didn't go through a deprecation process. Sorry in advance if this change affects your site.
		* `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_args`, there's no functionality left that could use this.
		* `the_seo_framework_facebookappid_output`, we removed `app:id` support.
		* `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_{$type}`:
			* This includes `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_excluded_post_ids`, which is gone.
			* This also includes `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_sitemap`, which is now marked as deprecated.
		* `the_seo_framework_warn_homepage_global_title`, we now use multilingual plugin detection via `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins`.
		* `the_seo_framework_warn_homepage_global_description`, we now use multilingual plugin detection via `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins`.
		* `the_seo_framework_tell_multilingual_sitemap`, we now use multilingual plugin detection via `the_seo_framework_conflicting_plugins`.
		* `the_seo_framework_site_options`, use WP options API instead to alter option name `'autodescription-site-settings'`.
		* `the_seo_framework_term_options`, use WP options API instead to alter term metadata name `'autodescription-term-settings'`.
		* `the_seo_framework_user_options`, use WP options API instead to alter user metadata name `'autodescription-user-settings'`.
		* `the_seo_framework_site_cache`, use WP options API instead to alter option name `'autodescription-site-cache'`.
		* `the_seo_framework_available_twitter_cards`, we couldn't make it work in the new API.
		* `the_seo_framework_wp_title`, this was for WP 4.4 titles. Use `the_seo_framework_pre_get_document_title` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_available_sanitizer_filters`, we changed how we update settings, so the older filters are no longer compatible. Use `'sanitize_option_' . THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_301_noqueries`, we changed how we update settings, and this filter was no longer compatible. Use applicable option filters instead, like `'sanitize_option_' . THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`, `'sanitize_post_meta_redirect'`, and `'sanitize_term_meta_' . THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_TERM_OPTIONS`.
* **Action notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `the_seo_framework_cleared_sitemap_transients`, used when sitemap transients are (probably) cleared.
	* **Changed:**
		* `the_seo_framework_seo_bar`, added the builder's instance as the third parameter.
		* `the_seo_framework_tab_content`, now uses `'args'` instead of `'params'` for its first parameter's indexes.
			* I didn't deprecate this because I don't think anyone uses it.
	* **Deprecated:**
		* `the_seo_framework_delete_cache_sitemap`, use `the_seo_framework_cleared_sitemap_transients` instead.
* **Hook notes:**
	* Excluded IDs cache is now cleared on `wp_insert_post` and `attachment_updated`, from `save_post` and `edit_attachment` respectively.
	* These are among the most prominent changes of over 35 others:
		* `[ \tsf(), 'html_output' ]` no longer runs on `wp_head`. Instead, `[ 'The_SEO_Framework\Front\Meta\Head', 'print_wrap_and_tags' ]` is now outputted -- remaining at priority `1`.
		* `_init_tsf` no longer runs on `plugins_loaded`, but on `init`. Use filter `the_seo_framework_load` instead.
* **JavaScript notes:**
	* HTML element with ID `tsf-description-reference` is no longer available. Use `tsf-description-reference_{$type}` instead.
		* `$type` can be: `autodescription_description`, `autodescription-meta[description]`, `autodescription-quick[description]`, `autodescription-site-settings[homepage_description]`, or `tsf-description-reference_autodescription-site-settings[pta][%s][description]` (where `%s` is the post type).
	* HTML element with ID `tsf-title-reference` is no longer available. Use `tsf-title-reference_{$type}` instead.
		* See above for `$type` hints, where `description` is replaced with `title` in every instance.
* **CSS notes:**
	* `tsf-pt` no longer has inline RTL support, but instead supports RLT built in its file.
* **Other:**
	* Cleaned up code. Reduced function call overhead.
	* Removed capitalization in PHP methods; mainly, `_ID`. Since PHP methods are case-insensitive at runtime, this should not matter nearly any case.
	* Fixed typos in code. Props [Viktor SzÃ©pe](https://github.com/szepeviktor).
	* Refreshed `composer.json`. Props [Viktor SzÃ©pe](https://github.com/szepeviktor).
	* Improved needless defense clauses. Props [Viktor SzÃ©pe](https://github.com/szepeviktor).
	* We now try to avoid the word "home" in our code due to its ambiguity in relation to the front page and the blog page. So, we use "front" for front-page related queries, titles, etc., and "blog" otherwise.
	* We no longer use `$escape` parameters in our code. You must escape as late as possible and not trust us blindly.
	* Class `tsf-breadcrumb` is now used on the front-end.

= 4.2.8 =

This minor update makes the SEO Bar easier on the eyes. We also improved compatibility with bbPress, wpForo, and WooCommerce, and added compatibility with another thousand plugins via Advanced Query Protectionâ€™s new plugin query variable detection. We also fixed a couple of bugs, added and improved syntax detection of SEOPress and Rank Math, introduced new APIs, dusted off some code, refined tooltip placement, added Site Icon as a fallback for the sitemap title logo, and perfected support for Custom Post Types by detecting [their changed arguments](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4059).

= 4.2.7 =

This minor update brings you a revamped HTML parser and a new option for tuning its accuracy for descriptions. First-time installers are now notified when metadata can be transported from other SEO plugins, the SEO Bar recognizes syntax from Rank Math, and Advanced Query Protection blocks new SEO attacks that could tank your rankings. We also [fixed a couple of bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4021).

*Psst: Check out our [Cyber Sale](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3527).*

*v4.7.2.1: Fixed syntax for PHP 7.2. Props [opicron](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/syntax-error-226/#post-16183422).*

= 4.2.6 =

This patch resolves an issue with WordPress 6.1, which queries template parts before posts are requested. This premature query causes TSF to fail in recognizing support for Custom Post Types, [preventing all meta output](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4015).

= 4.2.5 =

This minor update addresses a change in WordPress 6.0 that causes taxonomy sitemaps to crash, allows paginated deindexing to supersede forced indexing, and improves image cropping by [preserving metadata](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3929).

= 4.2.4 =

This minor update improves image processing, reducing TSF's load impact by roughly 20% when generating metadata. We also added WordPress 6.0 support for image filesizes, making social sharing [even more robust](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3903).

= 4.2.3 =

This minor update addresses a regression where the singular-archive canonical URLs always [pointed to the first page](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3858).

= 4.2.2 =

This minor update addresses a regression where the homepage canonical URL was [missing a trailing slash](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3841).

= 4.2.1 =

This minor update addresses a few regressions brought in v4.2.0; it fixes the canonical URL for paginated categories, corrects an API typo, and [rectifies a few edge cases](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3836). TSF now also supports PHP 8.1.

= 4.2.0 - Perfect =

*Come with me, and you'll be in a world of pure imagination. - [Gene Wilder, Anthony Newley, Leslie Bricusse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVi3-PrQ0pY)*

**Release highlights**

* This update brings new post-type-archive settings. You can now edit their titles, descriptions, social and visibility settings, and even add redirects on the SEO Settings page.
* Fancy a custom site title for SEO purposes only? Check out the new title settings.
* You will find that the sitemap's stylesheet now has its URLs centered; it also supports mobile devices.
* Developers can now enjoy using the new `tsf()` function -- an alias of `the_seo_framework()`.
* If you're a developer, you should also check out our perfectly tuned `memo()`. `umemo()`, and `fmemo()` [functions](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/blob/4.2.0/inc/functions/api.php#L155-L335), which help make TSF so performant.

**Perfect**

TSF is finally what I (Sybre) envisioned it to become when I first named it "The SEO Framework": It's lightning-fast, hassle-free, and has all necessary options while giving you the best in class experience. I hope you enjoy what I believe is a perfect product!

To me, The SEO Framework is finished. Done. It's excellent. This doesn't mean its journey ends here. Now, it's time to add features *you* want. A restyled interface, migration support, custom title generation, more structured data fields, and many other community proposals are under consideration.

**A perfect tip**

This update comes with updated browser styles and scripts. Not all browsers get these for you; so, the interface might appear broken (and your "inputs" seem to be "removed"). Try a different browser, or [clear your favorite browser's cache](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/how-to-clear-browser-cache/#how-to-force-refresh-a-single-page). That ought to do the trick.

**Environment upgrade notes**

WordPress 5.1 through 5.4 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Over 66% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using WordPress v5.5 or later.
* Newer versions of WordPress are faster, more reliable, and easier to work with; for both you and us.
* Supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.

PHP 5.6 through 7.1 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Almost 80% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using PHP v7.2 or later.
* Newer versions of PHP are faster and more secure. For us, they're also easier to work with.
* Again, supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.

**Support the development**

We hope you'll love this update as much as we do. Please consider supporting us by sharing [a fantastic review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/reviews/#new-topic-0), [get a license](https://theseoframework.com/pricing/), or do your friends and colleagues a favor by installing TSF for them.
